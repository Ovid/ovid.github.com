<h1><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>

<p>If you’re following along with AI, you probably know about <a href="https://openai.com/o1/" target="_blank">OpenAI’s new o1
model</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, released on December 5<sup>th</sup>, 2024.
Previously, o1-preview was the new “reasoner” model for OpenAI, released on
September 12<sup>th</sup>, 2024. I decided to take it for a spin and it was ...
a mixed bag. Part of this was me being frustrated that o1 was not able to read
my mind. Part of this was o1 being, well, and LLM. More on that in a bit.</p>

<h1><a name="reasoners"></a>Reasoners?</h1>

<p>But what’s a reasoner? OpenAI has broken down their approach to get to AGI
(Artificial General Intelligence)—where AI can generally act at or above human
ability on all knowledge-based tasks—in the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Chatbots (done)</li>
<li>Reasoners (in progress, but can “reason” about a problem)</li>
<li>Agents (in progress)</li>
<li>Innovators (they can make discoveries on their own)</li>
<li>Organizations (they can run an entire organization autonomously)</li>
</ol>

<p>Each step more or less requires the previous step and even though we’ve pretty
much nailed chatbots, work continues to make them consume less energy,
hallucinate less often, and mitigate bias. None of this is easy.</p>

<p>But reasoners? If you’re familiar with <a href="/articles/prompt-engineering-is-not-dead.html">prompt
engineering</a>, reasoners are
“let’s think step-by-step” on steroids, breaking down hard problems into
discrete tasks and solving them, perhaps backtracking if an approach appears to
be a dead end. Sam Altman has described o1-preview as being a reasoner on par
with gpt 2, today a very weak GPT, but almost miraculous for its time. As we
push forward with reasoners, it’s expected to be even better than today and
today is somewhat limited.</p>

<h1><a name="my-o1-task"></a>My o1 Task</h1>

<p>When new models are released, there are plenty of standard benchmarks models are
run against. Unfortunately, many of the benchmarks the models are run on get
published and incorporated in new model training data. That’s a problem because
the AI “learns” the solutions to these benchmarks. It’s like a student walking
into a test after knowing the questions.</p>

<p>So many people testing out new models have their personal sets of prompts that
they use and I’m no exception.</p>

<p>In the early days of ChatGPT and other models, I’d ask it to write a Fibonacci
function in Perl. It often got the right answer, but used recursion. I’d ask for
an iterative (non-recursive) version and it usually failed.</p>

<p>Today, foundation models are able to generate the iterative version of a
Fibonacci function, but even with Claude, asking it to <a href="https://gist.github.com/Ovid/aac242a6d7efd70d200d8929d79811d4" target="_blank">generate a <em>caching</em>
version of that
function</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> is
disappointing. <a href="https://gist.github.com/Ovid/2987274c68383727a31a8885bfde234c" target="_blank">You can see my cleaned up version
here</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. I won’t go
into detail about why my version works better, because that’s beyond the scope
of this.</p>

<p>With o1, I wanted to give it a <em>hard</em> problem, but one that I understood. I
wanted it to build a first-order predicate logic system in Perl, mimicking basic
Prolog behavior, using continuations. If that sounds non-trivial it’s because it
is. I’ll skip over many of the basics, but give you a feel for what’s going on.</p>

<h1><a name="prolog-in-perl"></a>Prolog in Perl</h1>

<p>A long time ago, a gentleman named Adrian Howard posted about <a href="https://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=193649" target="_blank">implementing
something similar to Prolog in Perl, using
continuations</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span>. It allows you to write
something like this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">sub male ( $var, $continuation ) {
    unify( &quot;frank&quot;, $var, $continuation );
    unify( &quot;dean&quot;,  $var, $continuation );
}

my $a = Var-&gt;new;

# print everyone who is a male
male( $a, sub { print $a-&gt;value, &quot; is male\n&quot; } );
</code></pre></div>

<p>That’s seems almost ridiculous, but suffice it to that this approach is
powerful and <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/aI-Logic/" target="_blank">I even hacked together a quick module to genericize
this</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-2"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> But Howard’s approach lacked some key
features, including list handling. That’s the bit I want to explain now.</p>

<p>Let’s say, in Perl, you want to append one list to another:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">my @result = ( @first, @second );
</code></pre></div>

<p>It’s easy and natural. In Prolog, you can’t naturally append lists, so you need
to write something called a <em>predicate</em> to allow this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-prolog">append([], List, List).
append([Head|Tail1], List2, [Head|Result]) :-
    append(Tail1, List2, Result).
</code></pre></div>

<p>That seems like a lot of work, but it allows you to write:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-prolog">append( First, Second, Result ).
</code></pre></div>

<p>Why is this a win? Imagine, if you already had the <code>Result</code>, say, a list
containing the letters ‘a' through ‘e' and you wanted to know all combinations
of <code>First</code> and <code>Second</code> that could generate that list. In Perl (or most
procedural or OO languages), it’s a pain. In Prolog, you would just write this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-prolog">append( First, Second, [a, b, c, d, e ] );
</code></pre></div>

<p>Printing the results might generate:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code>First=[],          Second=[a,b,c,d,e]
First=[a],         Second=[b,c,d,e]
First=[a,b],       Second=[c,d,e]
First=[a,b,c],     Second=[d,e]
First=[a,b,c,d],   Second=[e]
First=[a,b,c,d,e], Second=[]
</code></pre></div>

<p>I now have that working in Perl, using something similar to Howard’s approach,
but o1 wasn’t quite as helpful as I wanted. I don’t have many transcripts to
share because I was fairly certain that some context in the conversation was
causing difficulties, but <a href="https://chatgpt.com/c/67532d9e-897c-8009-ba8d-45c4df1d707c" target="_blank">this is my first conversation with
o1</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.  I used a
one-shot prompt and got disappointing results. o1 got some of Perl’s syntax
wrong and I had to prompt it to fix those.</p>

<p>Some errors it suggested I fix weren’t actually errors. For example, it told me
I had to load a module, apparently unaware that <code>use base $module</code> does that for
you.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-3"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span>. When o1 was getting bogged down in details like that, it
wasn’t fixing the actual problems I needed it to fix.</p>

<p>It also failed to diagnose a critical error where, in my manual changes to the
code, I had accidentally changed the namespace, causing the code to not be able
to run correctly, but the code it had generated would “swallow” some exceptions,
causing me to have to use the debugger to find the actual issue. That’s mostly
the end of that transcript I linked. The rest are unlinked.</p>

<p>Why did I stop there? o1 warned me that I only had 25 more requests available
and then I would have to wait <em>two days</em> before I could issue more requests.
Damn it.</p>

<p>However, I should note that while I was working through all of these issues, o1
was very, very fast compared to o1-preview, so that’s a win.</p>

<p>On the down side, the Perl code it wrote was very ugly, old-style Perl and I
need to manually clean that up.</p>

<h1><a name="handling-lists"></a>Handling Lists</h1>

<p>So after a bit of work, I got basic Prolog-style facts and rules working, but I
wanted to handle lists so I could write something like the <code>append/3</code> predicate
above. So I started prompting and eventually I got <em>close</em> to the solution and
had a test like this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">my $X2    = AI::Logic::Var-&gt;new;
my $Y2    = AI::Logic::Var-&gt;new;
my $count = 0;
run_query(
  sub {
    append(
      $X2, $Y2,
      [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' ],
      sub {
        # Each time we succeed, we have one solution.
        # We'll increment a counter. Once we have
        # all solutions, throw success.
        $count++;
        # Don't throw AI::Logic::Success immediately,
        # because we want to find all solutions.
        # The system will backtrack after continuation
        # returns normally.

      }
    );
    # After all solutions are exhausted, if no success
    # was thrown, we do so now.  But note: In your logic
    # system, once you run out of solutions, the run_query
    # ends.  To confirm we got all 6 solutions, we can
    # just check $count after run_query.
    AI::Prolog::Success-&gt;throw;
  }
);
is $count, 6, &quot;append(X,Y,[a,b,c,d,e]) has 6 solutions&quot;;
</code></pre></div>

<p>The test looks vaguely sane (aside from the fact that it’s not checking
that the six solutions are correct), but I was only getting one solution.
Multiple attempts to fix this failed and that’s mostly my fault.</p>

<p>First, when I explain prompt engineering to developers, I constantly remind
them that AI should be considered a “talented junior developer.” You have to
review the code and I was doing so much work I failed to review the code.</p>

<p>Second, I constantly try to remind developers that you should not use exceptions
for flow control (“should”, not “must”). Exceptions as flow control are usually
a terrible idea, but again, it’s beyond the scope of this article. However, it’s
relevant here because I ignored that the code o1 wrote was using exceptions for
flow control. As a result, it was throwing an exception after it found the first
solution rather than backtracking and finding <em>all</em> solutions.</p>

<p>I felt silly for not noticing that, but o1 didn’t catch that either. In fact, at
one point, it told me that I wasn’t supposed to throw an exception in my test
because that would block the backtracking, even though its own code was using
exceptions to block the backtracking! That’s when I reread this comment:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code># After all solutions are exhausted, if no success
# was thrown, we do so now.  But note: In your logic
# system, once you run out of solutions, the run_query
# ends.  To confirm we got all 6 solutions, we can
# just check $count after run_query.
</code></pre></div>

<p>I suspected o1 was reading that comment and getting confused, so I started a new
chat, removing that comment, and explained the actual problem. That’s when it
gave me an answer that failed, again, but differently. It actually gathered all
of the answers, but wrapped them up in <code>AI::Prolog::Logic</code> variables rather than
flattening them. So I reduced everything down to a simple base case, explaining
the issue, and o1 failed repeatedly.</p>

<p>I asked it to “flatten” the logic variables to lists and it was actually able
to remove many of the “exceptions as flow control”, but was now giving me 12
solutions instead of one or six. No amount of coaxing could fix this.</p>

<p>In frustration, I switched to Anthropic’s Claude, and eventually solved the
issue. My <code>appened/3</code> predicate now looks like this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">sub append ( $L1, $L2, $L3, $cont = undef ) {
  $cont //= sub { AI::Logic::Success-&gt;throw(&quot;Solution&quot;) };

  $L1 = AI::Logic::Var-&gt;new($L1);
  $L2 = AI::Logic::Var-&gt;new($L2);
  $L3 = AI::Logic::Var-&gt;new($L3);

  # Base case: append([], L, L)
  if ( unify( $L1, [], sub { unify( $L3, $L2, $cont ) } ) ) {
    return 1;
  }

  # Recursive case: append([H|T], L, [H|R]) :- append(T, L, R)
  my $H = AI::Logic::Var-&gt;new;
  my $T = AI::Logic::Var-&gt;new;
  my $R = AI::Logic::Var-&gt;new;

  # Push recursive case as a choice point
  push @CHOICE_POINTS, sub {
    unify_list(
      $L1, $H, $T,
      sub {
        unify_list(
          $L3, $H, $R,
          sub {
            append( $T, $L2, $R, $cont );
          }
        );
      }
    );
  };

  return _try( shift @CHOICE_POINTS );
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Without going into detail (again, because this is long enough already), the
above gives me the correct six solutions, at the price of a hideous syntax and
not being thread safe. Those are problems for another day.</p>

<h1><a name="summary"></a>Summary</h1>

<p>o1 is actually very nice and very fast and I suspect I will use it for hard
problems, but if you’re not very clear about your expectations up front, it’s
frustrating, it will do what you ask, not what you want. As I’ve discovered
with prompt engineering, you still have to have some expertise in the area
you’re working with or else it will be very hard for you to figure out why it’s
failing.</p>

<p>All in all, I still think this is a great step forward for OpenAI’s reasoners,
but it’s still not there yet.</p>

<p>And this article completely skips over the many areas where o1 kept mixing up
Perl and Prolog syntax.</p>
