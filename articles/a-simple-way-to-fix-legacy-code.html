<article>



<p>If you've been in this business long enough, sooner or later you're
going to be faced with a terrible problem: fixing the legacy codebase.
What follows isn't the only way to proceed, but it's a tried-and-true
strategy that unfortunately doesn't appear to be well-known. The core
of what follows is risk minimization. Assuming you're facing the
problem of fixing a legacy application, you already have risk and you
don't need more added to it. What follows is lower risk and lower cost
than rewriting the system from scratch.</p>

<p>If you like what you read here and you need help, especially with
Perl, get in touch with me and see how our company can help out.</p>

<h2><a name="why-you-probably-dont-rewrite-the-code"></a>Why You (Probably) Don't Rewrite The Code</h2>

<p>Before we start, there are a few things you should know. First, <a
href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/"
target="_blank">read this now-famous Joel Spolsky article about why
you should never rewrite your code</a> (trust me, read it, but don't
forget to come back). In that article, Spolsky makes a strong case
about why you should refactor your codebase instead of rewriting it.
Refactoring, if you're not familiar with the term, is the process of
making a series of gradual improvements to code quality without
changing the behavior. When you're trying to fix code, trying to
change its structure and behavior at the same time is begging for
trouble.</p>

<p>That being said, I don't believe in the word "never". If your code
is written in UniBasic, rewriting might be your only option since you
can't find developers who know the language (or are willing to learn
it). Heck, I used to program in UniBasic and I've forgotten the
language entirely.</p>

<p>Or if you're working with a relatively small piece of software with
low impact, rewriting may not be that dangerous.</p>

<p>But let's say you can find or train developers for the language
your software is written in, the software is mission-critical, and
it's a very large codebase. Rewriting begins to make much less sense.
Refactoring it means that you always have working code, you're not
throwing away business knowledge or obscure bug-fixes, and your
developers aren't starting from scratch, hoping they can make
something work. In other words, you're minimizing your risk.</p>

<p>That being said, many companies (and developers) still opt for the
rewrite. New code is exciting. New code promises new opportunities.
New code is fun but fixing old code is often seen as drudgery.
However, if you have a large, legacy codebase, the new code you're
writing is, by definition, a large project and <a
href="https://www.informationweek.com/strategic-cio/executive-insights-and-innovation/why-do-big-it-projects-fail-so-often/d/d-id/1112087"
target="_blank">large projects are very high risk</a> (emphasis
mine):</p>

<blockquote>In a landmark 1995 study, the Standish Group established
that only about 17% of IT projects could be considered "fully
successful," another 52% were "challenged" (they didn't meet budget,
quality or time goals) and 30% were "impaired or failed." In a recent
update of that study conducted for ComputerWorld, Standish examined
3,555 IT projects between 2003 and 2012 that had labor costs of at
least $10 million and found that <strong>only 6.4% of [IT projects]
were successful</strong>.</blockquote>

<p>That's an old study, but there's still plenty of newer work which
bears this out. The larger the project, the larger the risk. In fact,
of the large projects I have been involved with for various companies,
few were both on time and on budget. Some were cancelled outright and
still others dragged on, long after it was clear they were a disaster,
simply because no one wanted to take the blame for failure. One of
them today is approaching its fourth year of a one-year schedule and
is riddled with bugs and design flaws, but the company made the new
software backwards-incompatible, switched over their clients and now
have no way out. The only reason the company is still in business is
that they bought another company that is very profitable and is paying
for the company's mistake.</p>

<p>That last examples alludes to a dirty little secret that's often
not talked about in our industry: large-scale rewrites often exchange
one pile of spaghetti code for another. Rather than truly solve the
underlying problems, the companies have traded a known set of problems
for an unknown set of problems. If you need to fix your legacy code
it's because you need to minimize your risk; why on earth would you
knowingly adopt unquantifiable risk?</p>

<h2><a name="how-to-refactor-your-legacy-code"></a>How to Refactor Your Legacy Code</h2>

<p>Assuming you've decided that you don't want to face the cost and
risk of a large-scale rewrite, how do you refactor your code?</p>

<p>First, you need to assess where you are. At a bare minimum:</p>

<ul>
    <li>What are the functional requirements of the code? (very high-level here)</li>
    <li>What documentation exists, if any?</li>
    <li>What areas of the code are more fragile? (Check your bug tracker)</li>
    <li>What external resources does it require?</li>
    <li>What tests exist, if any?</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these things need to be written down so that anyone can
consult this information at a glance. This information represents the
bare necessities for the expert you're going to hire to fix the mess.
If the above list seems simplistic, that's because we're refactoring,
not rewriting.</p>

<p>And yes, you're probably going to hire an outside expert. Not only
will they see things that you didn't, but while your current
developers may be good, if they can't clearly lay down a solid plan to
fix the legacy codebase while simultaneously minimizing risk, you need
to bring in someone with experience with this area. What follows is
not always intuitive and the expert's experience will help you
navigate the rough waters you're already in. At a minimum, your expert
needs to have the following:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Expert in the primary language(s) of your codebase</li>
    <li>A strong automated testing background</li>
    <li>Very comfortable with <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage"
    target="_blank">code coverage</a> tools</li>
    <li>A strong database background (probably)</li>
    <li>An expert in system design/architecture</li>
    <li>Ability to admit when they're wrong</li>
    <li>Understanding of business needs</li>
    <li>A persuasive personality</li>
</ul>

<p>The last points seems strange, but hard choices will need to be
made and there will be strong disagreements about how to make them.
It's hard to find this mix in top-notch developers, but it will
definitely pay off.</p>

<h2><a name="getting-started"></a>Getting Started</h2>

<p>The first thing you'll want to do is get a rough idea of how you
want your new application laid out. Call this your architecture
roadmap, but keep in mind that your landscape will change over time
and this roadmap should be flexible. This is where your expert's
architecture skills will come in. Various functional parts of your
application will be decoupled and put into separate areas to ensure
that each part of your application has a "specialty" that it focuses
on. When each part of your application has one area it focuses on,
it's easier to maintain, extend, and reuse, and that's primarily why
we want to fix our legacy codebase. However, don't make detailed plans
at this time; no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy.
Instead, just ensure that you have a rough sense of where you're going
to go.</p>

<p>Next, you're going to refactor your application the same way you
eat an elephant: one bite (byte?) at a time. You'll pick a small
initial target to get familiar with your new tools. Over time, it will
get easier, but you don't want to bite off too big a chunk when you
get started.</p>

<p>Refactoring a large application means writing tests, but unless you
know what you're doing, you're probably going to get it wrong. There's
often little TDD here — the code is already written — and you can't
write tests for everything — you'll never finish. Instead, you'll be
tactically applying integration tests piece by piece.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is understand what won't change in
your application. By "won't change" I mean whatever it is that uses
your application's output, whether it be through a JSON API, a Web
site, a SOAP interface or what have you. Since something has to use
the software, that something is what is going to make everything work.
You're going to be writing integration tests against whatever that
something is. For the sake of argument, we'll assume we're refactoring
a Web application. You've decided that you'll start by writing tests
to verify that you can list users on your admin page.</p>

<p>Inside those tests, you'll create a browser object, log in as an
admin user, fetch the users page and write tests to assert that the
expected users show up on that page. Just getting to this point can
often take a huge amount of work. For example, how do you get code to
connect to a test database? How do you ensure data isolation between
tests (in other words, the order in which tests are run should not
matter)? Heck, how do you create that browser object (hint: Selenium
is a good choice here)? These and many more questions need to be
answered when you're first starting out.</p>

<p>Getting to to this point may be easy if you already have some
tests, or it may be very hard if you don't, but it's the important
first step in the refactoring.</p>

<p>Once you have that first integration test targeting a small and
(relatively) unchanging part of your interface, run your code coverage
tools over the test(s) to see what code is covered with these
high-level integration tests. Code which is covered is code which is
generally safe to refactor (there are plenty of exceptions, but that's
another article entirely).</p>

<p>Now you can start looking at which functional parts of the
application are embedded in that tested code and make a plan for
moving those sections into your architecture roadmap. At this point,
it's tempting to rip everything apart, but don't give in to that
temptation. Instead, focus on one piece at a time. For example, if you
have SQL scattered throughout the code, start pulling that out into
your architecture roadmap so that you have a clean API to work with
the data you need. Or perhaps you have a Web application and you have
been printing the HTML directly: look at using a templating system and
start pulling the HTML out into templates. Don't fix everything at
once or you'll be trying to do too much. Instead, focus on one area of
responsibility and understand it well.</p>

<h2><a name="dont-do-unit-testing-yet"></a>Don't Do Unit Testing (Yet)</h2>

<p>Note that we've been talking about integration testing but not unit
testing. There's a very good reason for that: with heavy refactoring
of a legacy system, your units will change quite heavily when you
first start, but the integration tests focusing on the rather static
interfaces will not. You want to spend time refactoring your
application, not your tests, so until you've stabilized how the code
works internally, unit tests can actually be a distraction.
Integration testing has the advantage that you can cover (if not
actually test) huge portions of your code at once and if done
correctly, can be very fast to write. Further, with poorly structured
applications, unit testing may be very difficult, if not impossible.
Integration testing will also help uncover bugs that unit testing
cannot: bugs where different components have different expectations
when talking to one another. However, there are some downsides to
integration testing:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Integration tests run slower than unit tests</li>
    <li>Bugs are harder to track down</li>
    <li>It's easier to break real things if you've not isolated your code well enough</li>
</ul>

<p>That being said, the advantage of integration testing at this stage
is clear: refactoring is much easier when you have some basic tests to
protect against the worst errors. It's also worth keeping in mind that
if you've done little to no testing before this, you're not
significantly worse off if you have some solid tests than if you have
none. Don't obsess too much on this point: you don't want perfect to
be the enemy of the good.</p>

<p>If you haven't already implemented a continuous integration (CI)
system, this is the time to start. Even if your developers forget to
run the tests, your CI system shouldn't. You want to find out fast if
tests are failing.</p>

<h2><a name="pushing-forward"></a>Pushing Forward</h2>

<p>After you've started refactoring one functional piece of a small
part of your system, you'll probably quickly uncover some bad
assumptions made in the original plan. That's OK. You've started small
to minimize your risk. Correct those bad assumptions and then start
integration tests with code coverage for another small part of your
system, pulling out the functional portions (database calls, HTML, or
whatever) that you've already been working on. When you feel
comfortable that you've shaken out some of the worst issues, start
looking at another functional bit of the system that your currently
tested code shares and see if you can pull that out.</p>

<p>Note that this is where your expert's architectural skills are
going to shine. They'll understand the importance of decoupling
different functional portions of the application. They'll understand
how to write robust, flexible interfaces. They'll learn to recognize
patterns in your business logic which can be abstracted out. Do not
hand this responsibility over to an existing programmer unless you are
absolutely confident they have the skills and experience necessary to
get this done.</p>

<p>At this point, what follows is a wash/rinse/repeat cycle which in
worst case scenarios can take years to finish. It takes a long time,
but it has some significant advantages:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The code is always working</li>
    <li>You're not paying to maintain two systems at the same time</li>
    <li>Business knowledge is not lost</li>
    <li>New features can still be added</li>
    <li>Tests can now be easily written to target existing bugs (even if you don't refactor that code yet)</li>
    <li>You can always stop if you've made your codebase "good enough"</li>
</ul>

<p>Why does this approach work? Any large project can seem daunting,
but by breaking it down into smaller, manageable pieces, you can at
least know where to start and get a sense of where you are going
without the nail-biting worry about whether or not a huge project is
going to fail.</p>

<p>When I've used this technique before, I've often found that it's a
pleasure to finally have a cleaner sense of how the code is evolving
and the current experienced team doesn't face the demoralizing
prospect of watching their jobs disappear. The downside of this
technique is that while code quality improves tremendously, there's
always a feeling that it's not good enough. However, as I previously
alluded to, many rewritten systems merely create new design flaws to
replace old ones. This is far too common of a problem and it means
swapping known problems for unknown ones.</p>

<h2><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The above strategy isn't appealing to many people and it can be a
hard sell to those who are convinced that newer is better. In fact, in
many respects it can be viewed as boring (though I love refactoring
code), but I've successfully used this approach on multiple legacy
codebases. However, if you're still trying to decide between a rewrite
and a refactor, keep in mind that this approach is a relatively
low-cost, low-risk approach. If it proves unworkable, you've likely
risked very little. If the rewrite proves unworkable, you could cost
the company a ton of money.</p>

<p>So the final question to ask yourself is when you should consider
fixing your legacy codebase. The only advice I can offer is to suggest
that you not wait until the storm before you fix your roof. Fixing a
legacy code base isn't rocket science, but it does require a degree of
expert knowledge in how to transform an existing codebase. Sadly, it's
not a skill most developers seem interested in acquiring, but then,
most don't seem interested in working on legacy codebases in the first
place.</p>
