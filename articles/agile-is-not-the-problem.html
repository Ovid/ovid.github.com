<h1><a name="whoops-they-did-it-again"></a>Whoops! They did it again!</h1>

<p>Making the rounds is an article in The Register with the delightful title,
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/05/agile_failure_rates/" target="_blank">Study finds 268% higher failure rates for Agile software
projects</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>So of <em>course</em> I had to dig in and find out what’s going on because almost every
time I read an article like this, it turns out to be by some company selling
their alternative to agile. This one was no exception. Though I can’t find the
actual study, I did find <a href="https://www.engprax.com/post/268-higher-failure-rates-for-agile-software-projects-study-finds" target="_blank">a write-up of the study’s
findings</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>It’s by a company called <a href="https://www.engprax.com/" target="_blank">Engprax</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. I’ll skip most of
what’s in there and instead focus on one key paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, new research conducted for a new book, Impact Engineering, has shown
  that 65% software projects adopting Agile requirements engineering practices
  fail to be delivered on time and within budget, to a high standard of
  quality. By contrast, projects adopting a new Impact Engineering approach
  detailed in a new book released today only failed 10% of the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh! That’s pretty horrifying! If true, we need to dump Agile and immediately
switch to Impact Engineering!</p>

<p>Hmm, what’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/106860574X" target="_blank">Impact Engineering</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>? I’ve
never heard of it. It turns out that it’s a new approach to project management
detailed in a book published by “Engprax Ltd.”</p>

<p>OK, so the study’s findings are very self-serving, but to be fair, it doesn’t
mean they’re wrong. So let’s look at a key line from that paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>65% software projects adopting Agile requirements engineering practices
  fail to be delivered on time and within budget, to a high standard of
  quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First, what’s quality? I’ve been consulting for many years and “quality” is one
of the worst catch-all terms I hear. It’s like “dysfunctional,” a word that many
use but few define.</p>

<p>Is quality lower defect rates? Higher performance? Satisfied customers?
Perfectly designed code? Who knows? Not one of those metrics requires or
excludes the others.</p>

<p>Engprax did not define quality.</p>

<p>So what about that “on time and within budget”? That’s pretty damning, eh? But
what does it mean? A day late and a dollar short? Who knows?</p>

<p>Because Engprax failed to show real numbers, for all we know, Impact Engineering
might be more likely to be “on time and within budget,” but have everything cost
twice as much and take twice as long. Because they didn’t link to the research,
apparently you have to buy their book to find out. I’m not going to buy their
book because I’ve seen so many of these fad methodologies come and go.</p>

<h1><a name="what-is-agile-lean-and-impact-engineering"></a>What is Agile, Lean, and Impact Engineering?</h1>

<p>To understand what’s going on, we need to know what agile, lean, and waterfall
are. If we don’t have working definitions, we probably aren’t talking about them
same thing. Fortunately, here Engprax provided working definitions.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Agile</dt><dd>Development starts before clear requirements, no complete
  specification, significant changes late in development.</dd>
  <dt>Lean</dt><dd>Only working on one project at once.</dd>
  <dt>Impact Engineering</dt><dd>Use of all engineering practices studied which
  increase success rates.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This is so jaw-droppingly dishonest that I hope whoever wrote this has a sense
of shame. It’s a straw man relying on the fact that agile snake-oil
salesman have so sufficiently muddied the waters that we can’t see the bottom.</p>

<p>I have been working in software for decades, using Agile, Lean, and Waterfall.
While they don’t cover waterfall, I can address the agile and lean definitions:
they’re total BS.</p>

<p>First, read the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">Agile Manifesto</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. Read through
<a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">their agile principles</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. In
particular, read the part where they write:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We abhor clear requirements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have you wondered why they wrote that? What? You can’t find where they wrote
that? <em>Because they didn’t</em>.</p>

<p>Out of the twelve principles they cite, this is, for our purposes, the most
important:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes
  harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Change” is key word here. The clear requirement is software that satisfies the
customer’s needs, but those needs are not always clear up front. But to
understand what that means, we have to go back to some basics.</p>

<h1><a name="what-is-project-management"></a>What is Project Management?</h1>

<p>There are many people who think that project management is about delivering
projects on time and on budget. This is wrong and a simple thought experiment
should make this clear.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re an experienced project manager working for Acme Corp. After completing
  your fifth project, your pointy-haired-boss pulls you aside and informs you that
  you’re about to be fired. He’s run the numbers and all of your projects have run
  an average of 50% over budget. You’re costing the company money.</p>
  
  <p>So you failed as a project manager, right?</p>
  
  <p>Then the CEO steps in, livid, pointing out that while this is true, all of
  your projects have been wildly successful in terms of customer happiness,
  revenue, and employee retention. Your projects have driven the financial success
  of the company.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course you need to control costs, so <strong>project management is about delivering
successful projects <em>while controlling costs</em>.</strong> And “successful” needs
meaningful metrics to judge it. That metric is not “X amount over budget.”</p>

<p>You build your project once. You keep your customers for years. It’s the latter
point which defines success, not the former.</p>

<p>So where’s the disconnect? And what costs are we controlling?</p>

<p>The following is, like many things, a gross oversimplification.</p>

<h2><a name="agile"></a>Agile</h2>

<p>Speculative projects are going to risk having to pivot quickly when
uncertainties arise. If they weren’t, they wouldn’t be speculative. This is
where agile shines. I’ve been on plenty of these and yes, the best ones have
clear requirements ... until they get into the areas where we don’t know how the
customer is going to respond.</p>

<p>The biggest cost threat is change and uncertainty. It’s appropriate when you are
trying to create a new market or a novel product in a market.</p>

<h2><a name="lean"></a>Lean</h2>

<p>By contrast, lean projects are where the market and customer behavior are fairly
well-known and you’re creating a proven product, but adding differentiators to
distinguish your product from the competitors. So you build a well-defined MVP
as your base and then iterate like mad, based on customer feedback, based on how
they receive the differentiators.</p>

<p>The biggest cost threat is waste: building something you don’t need. Hence, the
focus on a well-defined MVP as the base of your work.</p>

<h2><a name="structured"></a>Structured</h2>

<p>Also known as “waterfall”, it’s appropriate where the market has solidified
(ossified?) and you absolutely must not fail to meet requirements. Many utility
services fall into this category. Telecoms, electricity, ISPs, and others which
must have incredibly high reliability and predictability.</p>

<p>The biggest cost threat is deviation from requirements. At this stage, your
requirements are highly detailed, up front, and there is very little change or
uncertainty. Agile needs to “fail fast,” but that’s probably not a great mantra
when building a nuclear reactor.</p>

<hr />

<p>We can sum these up with the following image:</p>

<p><figure class="image">
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="/static/images/agile-uncertainty.png" width="600" alt="A graph showing agile with the most uncertainty, lean with middle, and structured with the least uncertainty.">
    <figcaption>The height of each bar conceptually illustrates the appropriate uncertainty level. </figcaption>
    </div>
</figure></p>

<p>Thus, for a given cost threat, you choose an appropriate project management
solution for that threat. If I’m an employee talking to HR, I don’t want a lot
of change and uncertainty. I also don’t want that with the janitorial staff. Of
course, there <em>are</em> janitors who have to deal with lots of change and
uncertainty. They’re called Navy SEALs.</p>

<p>This also has another implication: you have many different projects and those
projects have different cost threats, so don’t try to force everyone in the
company to operate off of the same project management model.</p>

<h1><a name="enter-the-agile-industrial-complex"></a>Enter The Agile Industrial Complex</h1>

<p>Jon Kern, one of the authors of the Agile Manifesto, argues that today we’re
struggling with what he calls the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/07/16/jon_kern/" target="_blank">Agile Industrial
Complex</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. I’ve seen them in
action and they have several key faults:</p>

<ul>
<li>Overemphasis on certification over practical experience</li>
<li>Proliferation of “Agile Coaches” with limited real-world experience</li>
<li>Misinterpretation and rigid application of Agile principles</li>
</ul>

<p>A key driver behind the organizations who are all promoting different versions
of “agile” is obvious: money. One well-known Certified Scrum Trainer® (CST)
wrote about how he lost his CST when he pointed out that Scrum is not always
appropriate.  This was apparently perceived as a threat to the Scrum Alliance
and they have a clause in the license that you will not disparage them. However,
as far as I can tell, you’re not allowed to <em>read</em> the license until you pay
them a lot of money for one of their courses. (I can’t link to his writing
because he quietly deleted that blog post)</p>

<p>Others are churning out highly-paid consultants specializing in
<a href="https://scaledagileframework.com/" target="_blank">SAFe</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, a framework I’ve never worked with,
so I can’t directly comment on it, but it has many detractors, most focusing in
the fact that SAFe isn’t agile. That being said, maybe it’s a solid approach.
I’m not qualified to say if SAFe is good, but I’m qualified to say that it’s not
agile.</p>

<h1><a name="solution"></a>Solution</h1>

<p>Pick an appropriate project management solution.</p>

<p>Is your project highly speculative and you’re unsure how your customers will
react? Go agile.</p>

<p>Is it a quick internal project that can be safely corrected if it gets a few
details off? Go lean.</p>

<p>Is it a cloud service utility to take on Amazon and Google? Go structured.</p>

<p><em>None</em> of these mean unclear requirements or specifications. However, the detail
of your specification vis-a-vis areas of uncertainty will change depending on
your approach.</p>

<p>It’s true that agile focuses on outcomes more than process. It’s true that agile
focuses more on building value than controlling costs. But if you choose a
project management approach that emphasizes controlling the cost of change and
uncertainty when your project has little change or uncertainty, it’s not agile
that failed. It’s you.</p>
