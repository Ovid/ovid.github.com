<article>



<p><a href="/articles/alan-kay-and-oo-programming.html">My discussion
of Alan Kay's ideas behind OO programming</a> made the rounds, getting about
13,000 page views (as of this writing) from various sources, including <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19968496#19969047" target="_blank">Hacker
News</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/bqu8td/a_simple_explanation_of_what_alan_kay_meant_when/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. There was quite a bit of discussion, most of which I'll
cheerfully let people decide for themselves, but there's one perennial
question, as exemplified by <a href="/articles/alan-kay-and-oo-programming.html#comment-4471360685" target="_blank">this response</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, which I really need to address.</p>

<blockquote>So, what exactly should happen when you request last_name on an
object that doesn't respond to that message?  ... It tells me you haven't been
the one receiving those 4AM phone calls, angry dictates from C-levels, and
responsible for hundreds of thousands of dollars (or even millions) of lost
revenue per minute of down-time.</blockquote>

<p>There was a lot of vitriol in the comment and I didn't want to respond to
that, but in this case, that vitriol actually strikes to the heart of this
issue. Specifically, I <em>have</em> been on pager duty for several companies,
getting those frantic early morning phone calls and that's helped to guide my
thoughts on what robust computing should be, and how you might handle objects
that don't respond to messages.</p>

<p>Back in the 90s, when I was a COBOL programmer for a huge insurance
company, I was responsible for writing software that would integrate
third-party data into our accounting system. Whenever I would write new
software, I would send that to our "operators", along with a series of steps
on how to restart the software if any step in our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Control_Language" target="_blank">JCL</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
failed. I <em>really</em> didn't want to get a late-night call, so I tried
very hard to ensure those instructions were clear, and even took the naughty
step of allocating more disk space than my software needed to guarantee that
<em>this</em> would never be a problem with my software. I knew the
main accounting software ran out of disk space every couple of weeks,
requiring costly work on the part of the developers and operators to
coordinate on resurrecting a batch job.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<p>Obviously, that was much earlier in my programming career. I didn't know
anything about OOP, had never heard of Alan Kay, and couldn't possibly
understand the core issues he was discussing, but I had done one thing right:
I wrote down very, very complete documentation that intelligent people could
use to restart my software if it failed. Keep that in mind: I gave a lot of
thought about how to respond if my software didn't perform as expected.</p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of decades to when I was hired to fix the ETL system
of a company working to reduce the costs of <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/what-clinical-trials-are/phases-of-clinical-trials#phase3" target="_blank">Phase III clinical trials.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-2"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> It was a large project, with many parts, but the ETL system had
been written a couple of years earlier by a doctor! I was rather surprised. It
was clear that he wasn't an experienced developer, but his work showed a lot
of brilliance because he deeply understood the problem space.</p>

<p>The ETL system was a bottleneck for this startup and honestly, no one
wanted to touch it. A new dataset would arrive from a pharmaceutical company
and it would take two days of manual effort from a programmer to get the dataset
into a shape where it could be run through the "ETL" system. I say "ETL" in
scare quotes because obviously you don't want to take a highly-paid software
developer off of their work for several days of manual data cleanup just so
you can process an Excel document. But this work was critical to the startup
and while they dreaded getting new data, they had to handle it.  So they
offered me a contract and the other developers wished me luck, happy to be
washing their hands of the mess.</p>

<p>After a few months, I had rewritten the ETL system to be a fault-tolerant,
rules-driven system that could handle the radically different data formats
that pharmaceutical companies kept sending us.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-3"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> More importatnly, instead of two days of hands-on
work from one of our developers, it turned into two hours of automated work,
leaving the developers free to do other tasks. So given that the data quality
was rubbish, how did I get there?</p>

<p> I had to jump through a lot of strange hoops, but here's an interesting
key: the pharmaceutical companies were astonished that we could get a year's
worth of work done in a month. They simply were not able to change their
processes and asking them to "fix" the data they sent us failed. So my job was
to fix it for them. And that brings me back to the main issue with Alan Kay's
idea about messaging. What do you do if you send a message and don't get a
response? Here's how we programmers <em>tend</em> to think of that:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">try {
    // This rubbish method names helps to illustrate that we
    // might have an unreliable source
	result = someObject.fetchDataFromServer(orderId);
}
catch(UnknownOrder uo) {
   System.out.println("Unknown order id: " + uo);
}
catch(ExistentialCrisis ex) {
   System.out.println("Server is sitting in the corner, crying.");
}
catch(Exception e) {
   System.out.println("Yeah, this blew chunks.");
   e.printStackTrace(new java.io.PrintStream(outputStream));
}</code></pre>

<p>This is the software equivalent of "Not My Problem." After all, the
<code>fetchDataFromServer()</code> method should return data! It's not
<em>my</em> fault if the other team's server sucks!</p>

<p>But I had no way of telling a bunch of multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical
companies to get their act together.  Making the ETL system work very much
<em>was</em> my problem. And by taking responsibility for that problem, I
wrote a much more robust system. So what do you when
<code>fetchDataFromServer()</code> fails? You do the same thing I did at the
insurance company when I sent instructions to the operators explaining how to
"fix" things when the software failed. Except that I'm sending that to my
software, telling it how to fix itself.  This requires teaching developers a
different way of thinking about software, something that goes beyond
<code>try/catch</code>, "not my problem."</p>

<p>So when <code>fetchDataFromServer()</code> fails, or when an object doesn't
respond to the message you sent, what do you? There's a simple way to approach
this: ask yourself what you would do in real life. What if you deleted your
partner's phone number by accident and you need to call him. Do you just give
up and say "not my problem?" Of course not. If he's ever sent you a text, you
probably have his number on the text. Maybe he sent you an email containing
his number.  Maybe your friend has his number and you can ask them. Or maybe
you can find a different way of contacting your partner. The choice is yours:
give up, or take responsibility for finding a solution.</p>

<p>Hell, maybe we should call this RDD, "responsibility-driven development,"
because what the programming world needs is new acronyms.</p>

<p>For the ETL system, I would have problems such as needing to know if "Dr.
Bob Smith at Mercy Clinic" was the same person as "Robert Smith (no title) at
Mercy Hospital." Sometimes those different records would come in from
different pharmaceutical companies, but sometimes they would come in from the
same pharmaceutical company; I'd still have to figure out if they were the
same person. This is the very definition of "bad data" but it was critical
that the ETL system work and, as it turns out, it's a fairly well-understood
problem and there are many approaches.</p>

<p>In this case, I would use various geolocation services to find addresses
and lat/long data for the locations (with fallbacks if a service was down). I
would create known "name variants" (in English, "Robert" is often shortened to
"Bob"), encode names with something like Soundex<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-4"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span>, stripped stop words from names, check
email addresses and phone numbers, along with their Levenshtein distance since
they were a frequent source of typos, and so on. By the time I was done, I had
a large list of things which were potentially identifying, and scoring to
indicate which sources of "truth" were more valuable.</p>

<p>By calculating a score, if it exceeded a particular threshold, we assumed
they were the same person.  Below a threshold, we assumed they were different
people. Between those thresholds, we flagged them for follow-up.  And if the
external geolocation services were down?  Fine! I just didn't get a score for
their data, but I still had plenty of other scores to help me calculate that
threshold.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-5"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> Surprisingly, we usually
had no follow-up records, despite often processing tens of thousands of people
per batch.</p>

<p>This is how you deal with unanswered messages. You <em>think</em> about
your response instead of just letting your software crash. Is it OK if you
don't have that info? Can you just leave a spreadsheet field blank? Are there
other sources for that information? Can you try later to fetch that
information, having designed a nice async system to make this easier? There
are <em>tons</em> of ways of dealing with these issues, but they all involve
more work, and different problems, of course, involve different solutions.</p>

<p>This isn't to say that there's always a neat answer, but curiously, as I
find problem spaces increasing in complexity, I sometimes find that there are
more solutions to bad data instead of just "more bad data."</p>

<p>There is, however, a little bug in this ointment: clients often want
software today, not tomorrow. As we're pushed harder to develop more software
in less time, struggling under <a href="/articles/the-tyranny-of-budgets.html">the tyranny of budgets</a>, we often don't have the time to make our software this robust. Even if it
would save the client a lot of money in the long run, they want to move
quickly and let their later selves pay down the technical debt. So I'll be
writing a more <code>try/catch</code> blocks in the future, because sometimes
it's really not my problem.</p>

	    <div>When I first
started, I only learned about this because we had a brand-new senior developer
on the team. After a couple of weeks of pager duty, she sat down one day to
fix the JCL to allocate enough disk space for all steps. When the lead
programmer found out, she tried to stop her, saying "but if the jobs
don&lsquo;t fail, they won&lsquo;t need us!" I never got along with that lead
programmer.<br><br>It&lsquo;s also interesting to note that the above story
refers to two female senior programmers. Our large mainframe staff had tons of
female programmers. It&lsquo;s a damned shame this is no longer true of most
shops.</div>

that&lsquo;s some of my proudest work, not because of the quality of my work,
but because it involved potentially saving lives. I wish I had more work like
that.</div>

not use Soundex, but I can&lsquo;t recall which alternative I chose. I only
mention this to stave off the inevitable "Soundex sucks" nit-picking which

	    <div>At this point, it&lsquo;s worth meditating
about neural networks and how marvelously they work with incomplete
information. They are powerful, in part, because we don&lsquo;t have to tell
them how to work around incomplete information.</div>
