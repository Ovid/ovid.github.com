            <h1>Alan Kay and OO Programming</h1>
            <time>2019-05-17</time>
            <hr>


<p><strong>Update:</strong> Many peoplea argue that messaging is flawed
because your software breaks if you don't get a response.  <a
href="/articles/alan-kay-and-missing-messages-a-follow-up.html">I wrote a new
article, begging to differ</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not going to link to the thread which set me off on this topic because
there's no need to embarrass the people who say things like ...</p>

<blockquote>Programming existed. Objects existed. Then [Alan] Kay contributed
"-oriented" to the term "object-oriented programming" and the world went wild,
but why?</blockquote>

<p>Or another person, objecting to Kay's criticism of "modern" OO
programming:</p>

<blockquote>"It's different than what I already know so it's wrong." This
kind of thinking is why I quit CS major, chose to not pursue a career in
programming, and haven't looked back.</blockquote>

<p>This was largely in response to Alan Kay's famous 1997 OOPSLA keynote which
is worth watching in its entirety.</p>

<div class="video-responsive">
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oKg1hTOQXoY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


<p>There's much more in that thread, and while some understood what Kay was
trying to say, many others seemed unaware of Kay's background and acted as if
he was some grumpy old dude who just graduated from a Rails Bootcamp.</p>

<p>This is <em>Dr. Alan Kay</em> we're talking about! He doesn't have random
opinions about "objects", <a href="http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html" target="_blank">he <em>invented</em> the word back in the 60s</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. He saw what was happening in the
programming world and was helping to craft many of these ideas, so he created
a word to make these ideas easier to talk about.</p>

<p>And he's still bitter about choosing that word. It made people focus on the
implementation rather than the behavior and it's all been downhill from there.
Or as Dr. Kay put it "I invented the term Object-Oriented, and I can tell you
I did not have C++ in mind."</p>

<p>Today, most developers think OOP is about classes and inheritance. Some of
the bright ones pipe up about encapsulation and polymorphism, but that's about
it. <code>class Dog isa Mammal {...}</code> has won.</p>

<p>But for Dr. Kay, he states that <a href="http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en" target="_blank">OOP
to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of
state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> Why? Well, part of
his background was cell biology and when he did the math on their
computational power, he realized that while software routinely has trouble
scaling, cells can easily coordinate and scale by a factor of over a trillion,
creating some of the most fantastically complex things in existence, capable
of correcting their own errors. By comparison, the most sophisticated computer
software programs are slow, tiny, bugfests. <em>Kay's</em> conception of OOP
starts with a single question: how can we get our software to match this
scalability?</p>

<h2>Isolation</h2>

<p>First, let's discuss isolation. This is a shorter term than "local
retention and protection and hiding of state-process".</p>

<p>The interior of a cell is messy and confusing, but the cell membrance wraps
this up in a tidy package, hiding the internal details. It's estimated that
around 50 to 70 <em>billion</em> cells die in your body every day. But you
don't. Could your software keep running if you had millions of exceptions
being thrown every minute? I doubt it.</p>


<p>You not dying when your cells die isn't encapsulation; it's isolation.
Consider the following (awful) example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">class MyExample:
    def reciprocal(self, num):
        return  1.0/num

example = MyExample()
print example.reciprocal(4);
print example.reciprocal(0);</code></pre>

<p>In the above code, we've encapsulated the reciprocal equation in the class, but
then ...</p>

<pre><code>0.25
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "class.py", line 7, in &lt;module&gt;
    print example.reciprocal(0);
  File "class.py", line 3, in reciprocal
    return  1.0/num
ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero</code></pre>

<p>The object dies, as does the code which contained it. This is the
antithesis of what Dr. Kay is trying to get us to understand.</p>

<p>If you think of Web browsers and servers as objects, however, we see
something closer to his vision.<a href="#1" class="popup-btn"> <span class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></span></a>
<span id="1" class="popup">
  <a href="#1-return" class="close">&times;</a>
  <span class="popup-body">Dr. Kay would likely take
exception (ha!) to this because to a large extent, servers send out HTML,
along with CSS and JavaScript and the browser needs to understand, not data
and metadata, but a very limited structure.</span>
</span>
<a href="#1-return" class="close-popup"></a>
 If your browser crashed every
time a web server crashed or was otherwise unavailable, Microsoft IIS would
never have reached 2.0.</p>

<p>Now that we sort of understand a core idea of Kay's, Lets take it further.
Kay points out that from the early days of Arpanet in the 60s, to the time of
his OOPSLA keynote in 1997, Arpanet had grown roughly 100 million times the
size of what it was.<a href="#2" class="popup-btn"> <span class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></span></a>
<span id="2" class="popup">
  <a href="#2-return" class="close">&times;</a>
  <span class="popup-body">And in the early days of the
Internet, no less!</span>
</span>
<a href="#2-return" class="close-popup"></a>
 And it didn't have to be repeatedly taken down for
maintenance every time we wanted to extend it. The internet, today, is
sometimes cited by Kay as the only working example of his OO model.<a href="#3" class="popup-btn"> <span class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></span></a>
<span id="3" class="popup">
  <a href="#3-return" class="close">&times;</a>
  <span class="popup-body">For kids today: the Web is a small subset of the internet and <a href=
"http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/interview-with-alan-kay/240003442">is
described by Kay as "a joke...done by amateurs"</a></span>
</span>
<a href="#3-return" class="close-popup"></a>
</p>

<h2>Extreme Late Binding</h2>

<p>Another key point is his arguing for extreme late-binding. What does that
mean? Well, consider this code:</p>

<pre><code class="language-perl">my $order = OrderFactory->fetch(%order_args);
my $invoice = $order->invoice;</code></pre>

<p>If you have multiple "order" classes, you may not know which class you are
dealing with, so you can't know, at compile time which <code>invoice</code>
method you're calling. OOP languages generally don't select (bind) the method
(<code>invoice</code>) for the invocant (<code>$order</code>) until run time.
Otherwise, polymorphism can't work.</p>

<p>But what's <em>extreme</em> late binding? Does the <code>invoice</code>
method exist? In a language like Java, that code won't even compile if the
method doesn't exist. It might even be dead code that is never called, but you
can't compile it if that method isn't there. That's because Java at least
checks to ensure that the method exists and can be called.</p>

<p>For many dynamic languages, such as Perl (I &#9829; Perl), there's no
compilation problem at all because we don't bind the method to the invocant
until that code is executed, but you might get a panicked 2AM call that your
batch process has failed ... because you might have encapsulation, but not
isolation. Oops.<a href="#4" class="popup-btn"> <span class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></span></a>
<span id="4" class="popup">
  <a href="#4-return" class="close">&times;</a>
  <span class="popup-body">Perl, like many other dynamic languages,
has features which allow the code for that method to be handled at runtime.
<code>AUTOLOAD</code> magic can handle this case, but that is an article for
another day</span>
</span>
<a href="#4-return" class="close-popup"></a>
. This is "extreme" late binding with virtually <em>no</em> checks
(other than syntax) performed until runtime.</p>

<P>Binding can also refer to binding a variable type to data.<a href="#5" class="popup-btn"> <span class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></span></a>
<span id="5" class="popup">
  <a href="#5-return" class="close">&times;</a>
  <span class="popup-body">This discussion conveniently ignores a large area of
comp-sci which asks why data and functions are different. Sue me.</span>
</span>
<a href="#5-return" class="close-popup"></a>
. While
this is a grotesque oversimplification of a complex argument, one way of
looking at the difference between static and dynamic languages is that static
languages such as Java often bind the data type to the variable (in other
words, the named container of the data), meaning that you can never assign a
different type to that variable, while dynamic languages such as Perl bind the
data type to the data itself, meaning that the data knows about its type, but
the variable often does not.<a href="#6" class="popup-btn"> <span class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></span></a>
<span id="6" class="popup">
  <a href="#6-return" class="close">&times;</a>
  <span class="popup-body">You can <code>bless</code> a
reference in Perl, so that the variable is aware of its type. This is how OO
is done in Perl.</span>
</span>
<a href="#6-return" class="close-popup"></a>
  The latter is late binding because you often
cannot infer, from static analysis, the data types at compile time.<a href="#7" class="popup-btn"> <span class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></span></a>
<span id="7" class="popup">
  <a href="#7-return" class="close">&times;</a>
  <span class="popup-body">Dynamic languages have static components and static
languages have dynamic components. The two are not mutually exclusive, but I
cannot possibly begin to cover that here.</span>
</span>
<a href="#7-return" class="close-popup"></a>
</p>

<p>Extreme late-binding is important because Kay argues that it permits you to
not commit too early to the "one true way" of solving an issue (and thus makes
it easier to change those decisions), but can also allow you to build systems
that you can change <em>while they are still running</em>! When was the last
time you changed the behavior of a program and didn't have to stop it and
restart it, often waiting hours for a complex recompilation?  If you've worked
with Smalltalk or Erlang you've probably had this pleasure, but most of the
rest of us are still struggling with the hell of Makefiles and scheduled
downtimes.</p>

<h2>Messaging</h2>

<p>We can kind of see the isolation and late-binding, but it's messaging where
Kay's message seems to fall down for most, even though he's quite insistent
that it's the most important thing there is in OOP. In essence, objects should
be able to announce that they did things and other objects can ignore them or
say "hey, that's cool. Here's what I did in response."</p>

<p>But that doesn't really get to the core concept of messaging and frankly,
this is the one area where I think Kay has been a touch vague, largely because
many developers think that ideas are nice, but they want to see an
<em>implementation</em> or proof of concept. In Kay's world. every object is
almost like an entire computer, not just a unique area of responsibility, and
each object can receive messages and figure out whether or not it knows how to
deal with them.</p>

<p>In other words, you don't execute code by calling it by name: you send some
data (a message) to an object and it figures out which code, if any, to
execute in response. In fact, this can improve your isolation because the
receiver is free to ignore any messages it doesn't understand. It's a paradigm
most are not familiar with, but it's powerful.</p>

<p>There's a lot more to be said about this, but I'll stop and instead direct
you to this article, written by Alan Kay, about <a href="http://worrydream.com/EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk/" target="_blank">The Early History
of Smalltalk</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. I actually found myself giddy reading that, getting a
glimpse into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrian_explosion" target="_blank">Cambrian
explosion</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> of computing ideas which happened during the 60s and 70s.
Sadly, computing, as with evolution, left that explosive era with powerful
tools, but fewer ideas. Functional programming is slowly gaining more
converts, logic programming is largely ignored<a href="#8" class="popup-btn"> <span class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></span></a>
<span id="8" class="popup">
  <a href="#8-return" class="close">&times;</a>
  <span class="popup-body">I enjoyed
Prolog so much that I wrote <a
href="https://metacpan.org/pod/AI::Prolog#AUTHOR">a Prolog interpreter in
Perl</a>. I also started a <a
href="https://github.com/Ovid/AI-Logic">continuation-based logic programming
system, but never got around to finishing it</a>.</span>
</span>
<a href="#8-return" class="close-popup"></a>
, but most programming
today is procedural or class-based OOP. But Kay's ideas of what he intended
for OOP are still with us. You can check out <a href="http://www.erlang.org/" target="_blank">Erlang</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and discover a marvelous
programming language where code is isolated, late-binding, and
passes messages around. And what do you get for that?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Extremely fault-tolerant code</li>
  <li>High availability</li>
  <li>Code whose behavior can be changed <em>while the software is still
  running</em></li>
</ul>

<p>That last point is a killer feature for many companies. The Erlang syntax
and behavior is strange for many developers (it looks a lot like Prolog with
the solver removed), if you have millions of customers counting on your
service to <em>always</em> be there, Erlang is a powerful option.</p>

<h2>OOP Today</h2>

<P>Kay argues (correctly, IMHO), that the computer revolution hasn't happened
yet because while our bodies are massively scalable meat computers, our
silicon computers generally don't scale in the slightest. This isn't just
because silicon is slow; it's because of things like <code>print
customers.fetch(customer_id).last_name</code> not actually having a
<code>last_name</code> method, throwing an exception (assuming it compiled in
the first place) and programmers getting frantic late-night calls to bring the
batch system back up. The only real upside is that it offers job security.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is where most of us are today. And would-be programmers get
silly lectures telling them that <code>class Motorcycle extends
Vehicle</code>, the instructor (<code>isa Person</code>) gets flustered
explaining for the n<sup>th</sup> time the difference between a class and an
instance, while a student (<code>isa Person</code>) in the back is noticing
that a bicycle looks an awful lot like a motorcycle and the code she's looking
at doesn't seem to account for this.</p>

<p>So class-based OO has won, <a href="#9" class="popup-btn"> <span class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></span></a>
<span id="9" class="popup">
  <a href="#9-return" class="close">&times;</a>
  <span class="popup-body">Er ... except for the
prototype-based OO in Javascript, though if you squint, it looks an awful lot
like single inheritance.</span>
</span>
<a href="#9-return" class="close-popup"></a>
 even with its limitations, arguments over
inheritance versus composition, static versus dynamic typing,<a href="#10" class="popup-btn"> <span class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></span></a>
<span id="10" class="popup">
  <a href="#10-return" class="close">&times;</a>
  <span class="popup-body">There is a delightful irony of class-based OO fans who
sneer at dynamic typing, but let's not go there.</span>
</span>
<a href="#10-return" class="close-popup"></a>
 and programmers arguing
whether "objects" are data with behaviors attached or vice versa. So this
sometimes puts me in an awkward situation when someone asks me what objects
are since the myriad disagreements are strong, and valid.</p>

<p>I sort of punt on this, taking a "meta view" of what we're trying to
accomplish when we write software. So I'll finish up by offering my view on
objects, with an extended quote from my book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Perl-Curtis-Poe/dp/1118013840/" target="_blank">Beginning
Perl</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<blockquote><h2>ÆVAR THE PERSONAL SHOPPER</h2>

<p>Many books have been written about OOP and even among experts, there is
often disagreement about what OOP is. Many programmers have tried to explain
OOP and leave the programmer confused. A case in point is the classic “An
object is a data structure with behaviors attached to it.” Although that’s
correct, that’s also an awful description and tells you almost nothing you need
to know, so instead of giving you a textbook definition, we’re going to tell
you a story.</p>

<p>You’re an awfully busy person and have little free time but plenty of
disposable income, so you’ve decided to hire a personal shopper. His name is
Ævar (any resemblance to reviewers of this book, living or dead, is purely
coincidental) and he’s friendly, flamboyant, and most of all, cheap.</p>

<p>Because Ævar is new to both your city and the job, you have to tell him
carefully how much money he can spend, exactly what quality of products you
want, and where to buy them. You may even have to tell him which route to drive
to pick up the goods and how to invoice you.</p>

<p>That, in essence, is procedural code and that’s what you’ve been doing up to
now. You’ve been carefully telling the computer every step of the way what to
do.</p>

<p>After a few months of explaining every little detail, Ævar gets upset and
says, “þegiðu maður, ég veit alveg hvað ég er að gera” (Icelandic for “Shut up
dude; I know what I’m doing”). And he does. He knows what you like and where to
get it. He’s become an expert. In OO terms, you might now be doing this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-perl">my $aevar = Shopper::Personal->new({
    name   => 'Ævar',
    budget => 100
});
$aevar->buy(@list_of_things_to_buy);
my $invoice = $aevar->get_invoice;</code></pre>

<p>You’re no longer telling Ævar every little step he needs to take to get your
shopping done. He’s an expert, and he has all the knowledge needed to do your
shopping for you and present you with the bill.</p></blockquote>

<hr>

<p>And that's it. Objects are simply experts. You tell them what you need and
they get it done. Forget all of the handwaving about blueprints or "data with
behaviors." Those are implementation details. And once you start thinking
about objects as simply experts about a particular problem domain, OOP becomes
much easier.</p>
