<h1><a name="celebrating-ten-years"></a>Celebrating Ten Years</h1>

<p><a href="https://allaroundtheworld.fr" target="_blank">All Around the World</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> is now celebrating its
ten-year anniversary. Managing director Leïla Contraire and I collaborated on
this post to talk about what we’ve accomplished.</p>

<p>It has been an impressive journey working with American, European, and British
clients with an international team. Stabilizing, modernizing, developing new and
old code, supporting, training, managing on-site teams.</p>

<p>And that’s not all, we have been expanding.</p>

<p>While at heart we are a Perl consulting company, we have branched out into a
variety of languages. We’ve done C++, Lua, TypeScript, Go, Python, Java, React,
and more. We still have Perl as a core focus, but being able to diversify not
only makes AAW stronger, but gives us the ability to appreciate different
approaches to problems.</p>

<p>So after ten years we thought it would be a great time to answer the questions
that people at conferences keep asking us.</p>

<h2><a name="what-do-you-do"></a>What do you do?</h2>

<p>Our job is to solve a large variety of concerns for our clients: untangling an
old code base, handling the work in-house teams don’t have time for, using our
expertise to develop new tools that the company has less experience with.</p>

<p>Old or new, there is always this excitement of being able to bring a solution.
Given our many years of experience, we have seen just about everything. It
doesn’t mean the work is easy—it often requires hard effort both from us and the
client—it just means that no matter what is thrown at us, there is this deep
certitude that we can solve it and that’s an amazing feeling.</p>

<h2><a name="what-makes-you-different-from-other-consulting-firms"></a>What makes you different from other consulting firms?</h2>

<p>In our experience when clients need a consulting company, they either want devs
who are going to deliver the company strategy, or they need people who can put
together a solution that will address all their concerns.</p>

<p>Because we care, we excel at the second. We love to come in, listen to the
client concerns and aims, and propose the best solution, taking into
consideration all the parameters. We love to bring flexibility in our solutions,
always keeping in mind that we are not here to stay. We are just a temporary
booster for a long-term adventure.</p>

<p>We can achieve that because our teams are special. They share our values. They
are dedicated, talented, and complementary. Working with them is like being part
of an orchestra. Everyone is essential, everyone is part of something bigger
than themselves, and seeing them work is simply magic.</p>

<p>In a way to go back to your previous question, we are bringing magic to the tech
world.</p>

<h2><a name="what-do-you-bring-to-your-clients"></a>What do you bring to your clients?</h2>

<p>What we bring depends on what the client needs.</p>

<h3><a name="rescuing-legacy-code"></a>Rescuing Legacy Code</h3>

<p>Sometimes it’s untangling a mess of legacy code, transforming an old system into
something maintainable. After understanding the code, we design an appropriate
architecture and gradually, layer-by-layer, transform the code to that
architecture. Sometimes we finish that work. Other times we evolve the code to
the point where the client is capable of taking over.</p>

<h3><a name="network-provisioning-automation"></a>Network Provisioning Automation</h3>

<p>Of course, we also build new tools. In one case, a transatlantic telecom client
was struggling to manage the costs of network provisioning due to it being a
manual process. Many large projects were stalled due to time spent managing
day-to-day tasks. We built a system that automated the provisioning, including
security, freeing their network engineers to work on the difficult problems that
actually required human intervention.</p>

<h3><a name="data-management"></a>Data Management</h3>

<p>Data management is another key area. We have found that even the best software
developers often do not understand how to design a database or structure large
amounts of data to be useful to their company. This often leads to complex, slow
code that tries to work around the limitations of their data. We get asked
to sort this out. This is often a delicate process, requiring extensive testing
as we slowly restructure the data and processes to deliver the quality the
client requires.</p>

<h3><a name="security"></a>Security</h3>

<p>Security and reliability are uppermost in everyone’s mind today, but they’re
often viewed in terms of cost instead of profit. As a result, they often get
ignored until the company’s hand is forced.</p>

<p>For one of our largest clients, most of their internal employees had full access
to everything on their system. In redesigning their access control they found it
both fragile and difficult to implement on a multi-million line codebase. We
were brought in and over the course of two years, we deleted large swaths of
their codebase, replacing it with a single configuration file and a handful of
supporting modules. The project was a great success and made it trivial to have
fine-grained control over access, even down to individual components on a page.</p>

<h3><a name="ab-testing"></a>A/B Testing</h3>

<p>Today, much of the software world has agreed that testing their software’s
behavior is important. But what about testing their customer’s behavior? Does
your new sign-up form increase or decrease the number of sign-ups? Can you prove
it? One of our customers could, but the A/B testing system they built was
difficult to work with. Because they put all of the data into a single database
table, the system required custom SQL be written for every A/B test. The SQL had
to be run from the command line to produce reports.</p>

<p>We rebuilt their entire system with a properly designed database, along with
beautiful front-end charts showing the performance of all tests for whatever
confidence level desired, including the ability to set the minimum number of
required visits per test.  Creating a new test only took a few few clicks.
Stopping and restarting tests, including adjusting the number of buckets was
trivial. A/B testing is a fantastic tool for discovering if your changes have
the impact you’re looking
for. You can stop guessing and start using a data-driven approach.</p>

<h2><a name="what-are-you-the-most-proud-of"></a>What are you the most proud of?</h2>

<p>The certitude that, as a team, we can address any problem that is given to us.</p>

<h2><a name="what-have-you-learned-during-the-past-ten-years"></a>What have you learned during the past ten years?</h2>

<p>There are three key lessons we have learned.</p>

<h3><a name="trust-our-instincts"></a>Trust our instincts</h3>

<p>If something is not right for us, it’s likely not right for the client or our
teams. We know when to say “no.”</p>

<h3><a name="hiring-is-everything"></a>Hiring is everything</h3>

<p>It is not just about assessing technical abilities, but also evaluating
communication skills, critical thinking capacity, and the candidate’s desire to
contribute to something greater. At our company, we take immense pride in a job
well done.</p>

<h3><a name="never-give-up"></a>Never give up</h3>

<p>Even in the face of adversity, we believe there is always an opportunity for
something more significant, happier, and worth building, just around the corner.</p>

<p>With these insights, we are better equipped to steer our company towards
sustained growth and success.</p>

<h2><a name="why-are-you-developing-a-game"></a>Why are you developing a game?</h2>

<p>Because we needed to create something we believe in, that belongs to us, to our
teams, something that lasts. We are immensely proud of our work on <a href="https://taustation.space/" target="_blank">Tau
Station</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>As for lasting, it has 8 years of development, and we are only approaching the
marketing phase.</p>

<p>It has been a labor of love, the sheer joy of using our experience to tell
meaningful stories, and the real struggle to make it happen.</p>

<p>Creating something—giving life to something—is such a different adventure than
consulting. It gives us perspective, understanding for our clients, as even in
our code base, we sometimes see the pain of legacy code.</p>

<h1><a name="what-would-you-like-to-say-to-your-future-clients"></a>What would you like to say to your future clients?</h1>

<p>Come and <a href="https://allaroundtheworld.fr/contact" target="_blank">talk to us</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. No matter the
problem, the need, we have the solution.</p>
