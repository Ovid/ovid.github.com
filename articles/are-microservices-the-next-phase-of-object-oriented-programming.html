<h1><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>

<p>I’ve been meaning to write this article for a while, but never quite got
around to it. Now I’m around it and I <em>know</em> that it will annoy a few people.
In fact, any time I read new discussions about how Dr. Alan Kay, the inventor
of the term “object-oriented programming”, intended something entirely
different from what we have today, the online discussions often devolve to
people acting like he’s some grumpy old dude who just graduated from a PHP
bootcamp.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want some extended discussions I’ve written about
  <a href="/articles/alan-kay-and-oo-programming.html">Alan Kay and OO Programming </a> and
  <a href="/articles/alan-kay-and-missing-messages-a-follow-up.html">Alan Kay and Missing
  Messages</a>. They’re
  not required for following along in this article.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1967, Simula 67 was released. This is often referred to as the first “true”
object-oriented language because it included these four feature:</p>

<ul>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Polymorphism</li>
<li>Encapsulation</li>
<li>Inheritance</li>
</ul>

<p>It offered many other features, such as subtyping, coroutines, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-event_simulation" target="_blank">discrete-event
simulation</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, but
those are just curiosities for the purpose of this article.</p>

<h1><a name="inheritance"></a>Inheritance</h1>

<p>Of the above list, the first three are generally non-controversial, but
inheritance has been a pain in the ass for over five decades now. The
following illustrates the core problem with inheritance:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">class Person :isa(Invoice) {
    ...
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>What the hell does that even mean? I suspect (though I can’t prove), that the
majority of issues we have with inheritance today stem from that core problem.
A subclass is intended to be a more specific instance of a parent class, but
that’s a semantic issue the programming language can’t determine. Instead,
there’s a kilo of fat shoved in our skull which has to figure out what that
means and we often get it wrong.</p>

<p>This is problematic enough that Alan Kay left inheritance out of his original
descriptions of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It’s problematic enough
that some OOP langauges (or OOP-like, depending on your definition) don’t allow
inheritance at all. Some allow multiple inheritance. Others only allow
single-inheritance but usually give you some tools to make life a touch easier
than simply composition and delegation (interfaces, mixins, aspect-oriented
programming, roles (Smalltalk-style traits), etc.).</p>

<p>Importantly, in class-based OOP languages, the classes define the behavior and
the <em>instances</em> of those classes contain the data (hand-waving on this quite a
bit, of course).</p>

<h1><a name="classes-versus-prototypes"></a>Classes versus Prototypes</h1>

<p>But what about the other features? They seem good, right? Well, there are a
number of <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?PrototypeBasedProgramming" target="_blank">protype based programming
langauges</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, such as
Javascript, Lua, Self, Io, and so on. In these languages, an object can
contain both data and behavior and you copy the object and add new data and
behavior as needed. To be honest, though, when I squint, I see single
inheritance in protype-based languages. I’ve never worked with one enough to
be confident in saying that, though.</p>

<h1><a name="dr-alan-kay"></a>Dr. Alan Kay</h1>

<p>But here’s someone who should be considered an expert on the term. Note that
he didn’t invent OOP, merely the term. And he’s not happy with where it went.</p>

<div class="video-responsive">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oKg1hTOQXoY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>This isn’t a classical “argument from authority” fallacy because I’m not going
to argue whether or not he’s correct. Instead, I’m going to argue that
microservices adhere much more closely to his idea of OOP than traditional
class-based systems.</p>

<p>In particular, <a href="http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en" target="_blank">he identifies the following three key features as the core of
his idea of
OOP</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Messaging</li>
<li>Isolation</li>
<li>Extreme late-binding</li>
</ol>

<p>All three of those are unusual enough to the minds of many programmers that
they’re worth digging into. I’ll be brief.</p>

<h2><a name="messaging"></a>Messaging</h2>

<p>In Kay’s view, you don’t call methods on an object, you send messages to it.
The receiver is free to respond however it likes, including ignoring the
message. For example, with a web server, you could send the message <code>DELETE
/foo.html</code> and it’s free to return a 400, a 404, another status code, or
simply drop the request. If you think of the server as an <em>object</em>, you’ve
sent it a message and it can do any damned thing it wants with it.</p>

<h2><a name="isolation"></a>Isolation</h2>

<p>Alan Kay actually said, “local retention and protection and hiding of
state-process,” but we often use the term “isolation” instead.</p>

<p>First, let’s think about encapsulation. If, internally, an object has a secret
key for encrypting/decrypting something, you don’t want that exposed. That’s
<em>encapsulation</em>. Many languages get this right, though I’ve found that many
dynamic languages make this hard to enforce. Fixing this is one of the key
drivers of the <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor" target="_blank">Corinna OOP project for Perl</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>But what happens if we do this (Corinna OOP syntax)?</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">class User {
    has $username :param :reader;
    has $password :param;
}

my $user = User-&gt;new(
    username =&gt; &quot;Ovid&quot;,
    password =&gt; 'hunter2',
);
say $user-&gt;username;   # &quot;Ovid&quot;
say $user-&gt;password;   # &quot;Method not found&quot; error
</code></pre></div>

<p>So I can instantiate a <code>User</code> object, send it to you, and you can see their
username, but not their password. That’s encapsulation. But if you try to
call <code>$user-&gt;password</code>, you also get an exception. That’s encapsulation, but
not isolation. Alan Kay referred to “state-process”, not just state.</p>

<p>Again, think about a web server and a web client. If the server throws a 500
error, or just catastrophically crashes, your client doesn’t suddenly crash
(unless it’s poorly written).  Instead, it gives you useful information which
you can then use to decide what action to take. In fact, Kay has described the
Web as being the most successful example of OOP ever invented.</p>

<h2><a name="extreme-late-binding"></a>Extreme Late Binding</h2>

<p>In many OO languages, we have <em>early binding</em> where the class is used to
resolve, at compile time, the method that is to be called. You will get
compile time errors if the method does not exist.</p>

<p>In late binding, we use the <em>instance</em> to determine resolve, at runtime, the
method that is to be called. If you don’t know what kind of instance you have,
you can get runtime errors if the method does not exist.</p>

<p>So what’s extreme late binding? The method might not even exist when it’s
called, but it still resolves, or its behavior might change between calls
because you’ve found a more efficient or accurate implementation! Smalltalk
and Erlang are two languages known to easily support this. Surprisingly, Perl
can as well, using the <code>AUTOLOAD</code> feature. Here’s a silly example using the
Corinna syntax, with a few speculative (made-up) features to make the example
clearer:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">class SomeClass {
    has @objects;

    ADJUST {
        # populate @objects
    }

    method AUTOLOAD ($method, @args) {
        foreach my $object (@objects) {
            if ( $object-&gt;can($method, @args) ) {
                $MOP-&gt;class-&gt;add_method(
                    $method,
                    method { $object-&gt;$method(@args) }
                );
                return $self-&gt;$method(@args);
            }
        }
        return;
    }
}

my $instance = SomeClass-&gt;new;

 # return $object-&gt;frobnicate(42) from the first composed object
 # which can handle the request
$instance-&gt;frobnicate(42);
</code></pre></div>

<p>In the above example, <code>SomeClass</code> doesn’t implement any methods at all, but if
you call one that doesn’t exist, it installs one that delegates to an object
having that method. Later calls would call the installed method instead of
<code>AUTOLOAD</code>.</p>

<p>We can again use the web server/client analogy to explain this. A browser
makes a request and the web server may not even be designed to handle the
request but serves a result anyway. It might even later cache that request so
it doesn’t have to recompute it. You don’t know. You don’t care. You only
know you made a request and got a response. Hopefully it’s a useful response.</p>

<p>The intent behind extreme late-binding is to protect you from committing too
early to an implementation that may not be what you need (or even needed), but
allow you to respond to the method/message if appropriate.</p>

<h1><a name="microservices"></a>Microservices</h1>

<p>There’s a lot of confusion about microservices and SOA (Service-Oriented
Architecture) and I cover some of it in <a href="https://dev.to/ovid/rewriting-the-monolith-part-2-2bgf" target="_blank">this
article</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Microservices are generally expected to have all the logic and data they
  need to perform a task. They’re not coordinating with a bunch of other
  services and thus are loosely coupled and fit well with agile development.</p>
  
  <p>SOA services, however, need to coordinate with other services in the same
  way that your <code>Order</code> object needs a <code>Collection</code> of <code>Item</code> objects, along
  with a <code>Customer</code> object, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A microservice is self-contained and might duplicate code in a way that SOA
does not, but it’s completely isolated from the rest of the code. It’s
basically a process/server running that has an API (messages), isolates
<em>everything</em>, and can use extreme late-binding if it wishes to.</p>

<p>Thus, if you aspire to Dr. Kay’s model (and the success of the internet is a
powerful testimonial), you may want to look at microservices. Some people look
at microservices as being a silly fad, but they’re a fad that’s been around
for quite some time and more and more companies are using them. In fact, our
company, <a href="https://allaroundtheworld.fr" target="_blank">All Around the World</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> is routinely
getting more requests from clients about implementing SOA/microservices for
their systems.</p>

<p>One interesting point about microservices (which SOA might struggle with) is
that the extreme isolation of them combined with an OpenAPI interface means
that you can separate off a layer of your system as a microservice, make sure
it works, and then easily rewrite it in another programming language that
might be more appropriate to the task at hand. That’s often extremely hard to
do when you directly use/import/require/include a module because it’s usually
required to be in the same language.</p>

<h1><a name="a-little-secret"></a>A Little Secret</h1>

<p>But if you agree with the idea that microservices might be the next step in
OOP, along the lines of what Alan Kay proposed, perhaps we should keep this
our little secret, shall we? OOP “purists” might be horrified at the
description and OOP “haters” might be aghast at realizing they’ve been writing
objects all this time. Admitting that microservices are objects might be a
marketing disaster, even if it’s true.</p>
