<p>When I was working with the BBC, the age-old debate had arisen again: should
we use "cuddled elses" or not?<a href="#1" class="popup-btn"> <span class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></span></a>
<span id="1" class="popup">
  <a href="#1-return" class="close">&times;</a>
  <span class="popup-body">This is from memory. It could
have been some other trivial detail we were debating.</span>
</span>
<a href="#1-return" class="close-popup"></a>
 For those not
familiar with the debate, it's asking if we should do this:</p>

<pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-java">if (someCondition) {
    System.out.println(&quot;We all gonna die&quot;);
} else {
    System.out.println(&quot;We not gonna die&quot;);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or this:</p>

<pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-java">if (someCondition) {
    System.out.println(&quot;We all gonna die&quot;);
}
else {
    System.out.println(&quot;We not gonna die&quot;);
}
</code></pre>

<p>For those of you who are not software developers, the differences might seem
pedantic. For those of you who <em>are</em> software developers, the difference <em>is</em>
pedantic. Unfortunately, it caused a furious debate (as it often does) at the
BBC and, as often happens with these debates, work isn't done. Sometimes
tempers flare. And quite often a decision isn't made.</p>

<p>And that's actually bad because one developer might "cuddle" that <code>else</code> and
another developer working on this code might "uncuddle" it. And they're not
being malicious or petty: "correctly" formatting code is simply something an
experienced developer does as part of their job. And that means more commits
to your version control system and more work digging through those commits if
you're trying to figure out why something was written in a particular way.</p>

<p>Or worse, you have a developer who decides to write code to format the entire
codebase in their personal style and running <code>git annotate $filename</code> shows
that developer on all the lines. So you contact this "expert" about the
<code>$filename</code> and they say they've never heard of it. I've run across this mess
more than once.</p>

<p>Getting back to the BBC ...</p>

<p>We had agreed we'd use <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Tidy" target="_blank"><code>Perl::Tidy</code></a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> to automatically format our code, but at that point, we hit
<em>another</em> obstacle because everyone argued about the brace style (if you don't
know what that means, trust me, you don't care) and no matter how hard we
tried, <code>Perl::Tidy</code> couldn't get the curly braces formatted the way we wanted
them to be formatted.</p>

<p>My argument was "who cares? We'll get used to the new styles. Let's get back
to work." But another developer, passionate about his brace placement, argued
that he could write a <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/PPI" target="_blank"><code>PPI</code></a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
hook to fix this. Sigh.</p>

<p>I quietly bet another developer £5 that this approach would not work.  I'm sad
to say I won that bet. Worse, when the "solution" was ready, it kept hitting
edge cases in our code and breaking.</p>

<p>And if you really want to see what a ridiculous timesink this can be, you can
choose many different indentation styles such as K&amp;R (and its many variants),
Allman, Pico, Ratliff, GNU, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style" target="_blank">ad nauseum</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></p>

<p><strong>What a waste of time!</strong></p>

<p>The icing on the cake? Though we know having regular formatting of code to
show the logical structure of the program makes it easier to follow the code
(proof: read minimized Javascript versus unminimized), there's no strong
evidence (that I've ever found) a <em>particular</em> type of formatting is better
than another. If you disagree, please provide non-anecdotal evidence.</p>

<p>In fact, in the excellent book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670" target="_blank">Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction, Second
Edition</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, by Steve McConnell, he dives into this at the beginning of
chapter 31. After some discussion of the topic, including referencing some
studies on said topic, he concludes (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Expert programmers often cling to their own styles tenaciously, even when
  they’re vastly different from other styles used by other expert programmers.
  The bottom line is that <strong>the details of a specific method of structuring a
  program are much less important than the fact that the program is structured
  consistently</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unsurprisingly, these arguments about brace style, cuddled elses, tabs versus
spaces,<a href="#2" class="popup-btn"> <span class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></span></a>
<span id="2" class="popup">
  <a href="#2-return" class="close">&times;</a>
  <span class="popup-body">Actually, there are strong arguments for tabs
regarding accessibility for those with poor vision, but I still prefer spaces.
I'm as irrational as everyone else.</span>
</span>
<a href="#2-return" class="close-popup"></a>
 and so on, are almost meaningless. To
be fair, there is marginal value to be had in suggesting things such as
"shorter variable names for smaller scopes" and "indent to show logical
structure", but being too pedantic about it pisses people off for no good
reason.</p>

<p>So how do we fix this?</p>

<p>First, pick a reasonable style you can <em>automate</em>, swallow your pride
about the details, and choose your automation tools. Second, consider
that—unless you're pair programming—noone really cares much about the
font you're using, do they? Not really. You've set your editor to choose your
own font and that's not written back to your source code, so set your editor
to choose your own style and make sure <em>it's</em> not written back to the source
code.</p>

<p>So let's say you prefer spaces to tabs, with a four-space indent, and you
use vim to edit your code. When you open a file, or create a new one, using
the <code>BufRead,BufNewFile</code> commands is the first thing you need, or you can
create a mapping to apply your style. For example, in your filetype mappings
you can add the following:</p>

<pre class="scrolled"><code>noremap &lt;silent&gt; &lt;leader&gt;ms :call s:ApplyMyStyle()&lt;cr&gt;

function! s:ApplyMyStyle()
    &quot; set up my editor to do the right thing
    setfiletype perl
    set expandtab
    set textwidth=78
    set tabstop=4
    set shiftwidth=4
    set expandtab
    retab &quot; apply my tab/space choices
    &quot; reformat the file
    execute(&quot;:%!perltidy -q --profile=myperltidyrc&quot;)
endfunction
</code></pre>

<p>Now, assuming your leader is the backslash, you can type <code>\ms</code> to apply your
coding style and never, ever have to pay attention to the silly choices other
developers make.</p>

<p>Do I recommend this technique? Absolutely not. You're going to commit in your
own style one day. However, <a href="https://github.com/mlawren/githook-perltidy" target="_blank">there are git hooks
you can write to apply styles when you commit</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. It's much safer. A better
choice, still, is to just be an adult and admit your "one true style" is
a personal preference, not a mandate handed down from heaven. Learn to use the
house style in preference to your own and avoid all of the petty arguments in
the first place. You won't look like a better person for it, but you'll look
like a worse one if you tell the other programmers they're fools for
choosing a style different from your own.</p>
