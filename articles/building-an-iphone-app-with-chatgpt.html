<h1><a name="preface"></a>Preface</h1>

<p>I’ve been asked to speak at the <a href="https://www.perl-workshop.de/" target="_blank">2024 German Perl/Raku Workshop in
Frankfurt</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and the theme of this year’s workshop
is Generational AI. I’ve been using <a href="/articles/using-github-copilot-with-vim.html">Copilot for
Vim</a> and doing work with Python
and the <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/" target="_blank">Llama-2</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> large language model, so I figured
I’d have no problem contributing, but first I had better brush up on my AI
background. The ensuing rabbit hole was a nightmare, but worth it. <span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<p>I’ve been working with ChatGPT 4 long enough and seen enough articles about
people building full applications with it that I thought it was time to give it
a try, but I wanted an app I could use, not some toy for a demo.</p>

<h1><a name="my-shopping-app"></a>My Shopping App</h1>

<p>When I go shopping, I use the Notes application on my iPhone. I’ve long hated
it. I add items that I want to buy to a list. My list is long and when I search
for an item and I don’t see it, I add it again and I have duplicates. I
frequently find I’ve added “rice” multiple times.</p>

<p>I wanted a new app, but the App store was a joke. Asking a shopping list
application not to track me across the Internet? Having to view ads if I don’t
pay for the privilege of making a shopping list? The opportunity to send my
grocery list to my friends and family?</p>

<p>I wanted a dead simple application to handle my grocery list, so I asked ChatGPT
to build one for me. It was my first time building an app with ChatGPT and it
took me about two hours. Much of that was my learning curve. Getting used to
this means I can make these apps even faster.</p>

<p><figure class="image">
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="/static/images/chatgpt-shopping.png" width="600" alt="XCode project of my Shopping App">
    <figcaption>XCode project of my Shopping App </figcaption>
    </div>
</figure></p>

<p>It’s worth noting that while I’ve done Android development with Kotlin, I know
nothing about the iOS ecosystem or the Swift programming language. The first
time I thought about developing apps for the iPhone was back in the early days,
when Objective-C was king and memory management was still manual. I took one
look at the code and my wife had to stop me from jabbing a fork in my eye.
I’ve never looked back. Until now.</p>

<h1><a name="why-not-copilot"></a>Why Not Copilot?</h1>

<p>You might be wondering why I didn’t just use Copilot? First, <a href="https://github.com/intitni/CopilotForXcode?tab=readme-ov-file#installation-and-setup" target="_blank">Copilot
integration with XCode is incredibly
painful</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
and after a long time fighting with it, XCode finally had Copilot, but I
couldn’t get it to make any suggestions, so I just gave up. It wasn’t the point
of what I was trying to do.</p>

<p>Second, Copilot’s just not a good fit for this (yet). Putting aside—for the
moment—the problems with hallucinations, you can think of Copilot as
autocomplete for methods. Where do I put those methods in an XCode application?
I had no clue. ChatGPT, however, is autocomplete for <em>ideas</em>. It’s “top down”
instead of “bottom up” and that’s exactly what I needed.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-2"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<h1><a name="my-first-prompt"></a>My First Prompt</h1>

<p>Since I’ve been doing a deep dive into this area, I had a pretty good idea of
what to expect. The clearer and more structured your prompt is to ChatGPT, the
better your output (note: this is all ChatGPT 4. Earlier versions are far less
capable). So I approached this like a product owner, detailing the exact
requirements for the application that the customer (me) would need.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would like to create a small shopping list app in Swift for the iPhone. I have a newer version of XCode.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>The app should allow me to enter and delete food items to buy.</li>
  <li>Each entry should have a checkbox to the left. Unchecked items should appear at the top, checked items at the bottom.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-3"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></li>
  <li>At the top of the screen should be a large title which says “Shopping.”</li>
  <li>At the bottom of the screen should be two buttons. One says “Alpha” and the other says “Frequency.”<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-4"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></li>
  <li>If I click on the button which says “Alpha”, all items should be sorted first by unchecked and the checked status. A secondary, alphabetical sort for each checked and unchecked section.</li>
  <li>If I click on the button which says “Frequency,” all items should be sorted first by unchecked and the checked status. A secondary, sort for the frequency with which I first entered or unchecked each item.</li>
  <li>The application needs storage to save the number of times I’ve entered or unchecked each item.</li>
  <li>After I close and reopen the app, it should show the list in the last state it was observed.</li>
  <li>If I delete an item from the list, it should also be deleted from storage.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>That might seem like a lot of work, but the up-front effort pays off.</p>

<p>ChatGPT responded quickly with a detailed outline. I’ve reproduced a shorter
version below,
but rather than overwhelm the reader, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gDMIBPKL2eb4ublOI0cgNeF2AqciNtF64mYpAqiUUOE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">I’ve included the full transcript in this
Google
document</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
I’ve turned on commenting on that document, so feel free to add your own.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Creating a shopping list app with the features you’ve described in SwiftUI is a comprehensive project that will give you a good understanding of many SwiftUI concepts and data persistence. Here’s a high-level overview of how you can implement it:</p>
  
  <p>Step 1: Define Your Data Model</p>
  
  <p>First, you need to create a data model for your shopping items. This model should include properties for the item’s name, checked status, and frequency.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code>import Foundation

struct ShoppingItem: Identifiable, Codable {
    var id = UUID()
    var name: String
    var isChecked: Bool
    var frequency: Int
}
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>(After this, I’ll skip the detail)</p>
  
  <p>Step 2: Create a View Model</p>
  
  <p>Step 3: Build the User Interface</p>
  
  <p>Step 4: Implement Data Persistence</p>
  
  <p>Step 5: Handling State and Sort Logic</p>
  
  <p>Step 6: Testing and Refinement</p>
  
  <p>Conclusion</p>
  
  <p>This outline provides a framework to get started. Each step requires detailed
  implementation, and you’ll need to write Swift code in the view model and
  ContentView to handle the specific behaviors like sorting and persistence.
  Remember to test each part of your app as you develop it. Good luck!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was a clear, comprehensive outline of an approach I could take and I
immediately hit my first bug:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That looks great! The ShoppingListViewModel is giving me the error “Cannot find ‘saveItems' in scope”. How do I fix that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And ChatGPT dutifully explained how to fix it.</p>

<p>From there, it was a constant flow of me asking it to explain subsequent steps
in more detail, prompting it for bug fixes, and gradually watching an iPhone app
come to life before my eyes.</p>

<h1><a name="challenges"></a>Challenges</h1>

<h2><a name="no-editor-integration"></a>No Editor Integration</h2>

<p>The single biggest problem currently is that ChatGPT has no direct integration
with your editor. You need to constantly copy-n-paste the code. For a
non-programmer, this could easily be a daunting task, unsure of where and how to
do this. So for now, you can try this at home, but if you’re not a software
developer, you might struggle. However, you can always ask ChatGPT for more
information on how to handle this. But that brings us to the problem of context
length.</p>

<h2><a name="context-length"></a>Context Length</h2>

<p>Early versions of ChatGPT had a “context length” of about 2,000 tokens. The
context length is how much of the conversation the language model remembers.
These aren’t just words, they’re tokens. Consider the sentence “I ain’t done
here.” Four words, but five tokens:<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-5"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<ol>
<li>“I”</li>
<li>" ain’t”</li>
<li>" done”</li>
<li>" here”</li>
<li>“.”</li>
</ol>

<p>But some LLMs have much longer tokens!</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&gt; open up the new
~125k Baichuan2 vocab<br>&gt; find a single token just for &quot;Guided by Xi
Jinping&#39;s thoughts of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new
era&quot;<br>&gt; 😬<br>&gt; finds another token just for &quot;On our journey
to achieve beautiful ideals and big goals&quot;<br>&gt; 🥹 <a
href="https://t.co/iJzlk0E1zi">pic.twitter.com/iJzlk0E1zi</a></p>&mdash; Susan
Zhang (@suchenzang) <a
href="https://twitter.com/suchenzang/status/1702126326369636631?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September
14, 2023</a></blockquote>

<p><script async
src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>As a general rule for ChatGPT, you can multiply token length by 75% to get a
rough word count, so 2,000 tokens is about 1,500 words it “remembers” in the
conversation.</p>

<p>For ChatGPT 4, we’re just over 4,000 tokens in context length. That’s about
3,000 words, or roughly the length of a standard book chapter. For long,
extended work building an application, we need to resort to <a href="https://blog.gdeltproject.org/googles-bard-vs-openais-chatgpt-summarizing-an-abc-evening-news-broadcast/" target="_blank">prompt
chaining</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
(which can be very problematic because you still lose context) or embedding
relevant snippets of code from previous parts of the conversation to help
ChatGPT “remember” what it was doing. This requires more attention on the part
of the developer and if you get it wrong, ChatGPT will, too.</p>

<p>ChatGPT 4-turbo, which as of this writing, is listed as not ready for production
use, has a whopping 128K context length! That’s about 96 thousands words, the
length of a decent-sized novel. Also, it’s rumored that 4-turbo is two to three
times faster than ChatGPT 4, so it will be much easier to build large
applications and have ChatGPT follow along.</p>

<p>That being said, I often work with codebases which have millions of lines of
code. Even a 128K context length isn’t going to follow that.</p>

<p>As an aside, <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-as-an-interactive-rpg/" target="_blank">people are having fun using ChatGPT to create text
adventures</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
but the 4K context length means ChatGPT will often “forget” previous parts of
the story. ChatGPT 4-turbo will be a real game changer (heh) here.</p>

<h2><a name="xcode-is-buggy"></a>XCode is Buggy</h2>

<p>Curiously, one of the biggest challenges wasn’t ChatGPT, it was XCode. I had
just updated to the latest version<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-6"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> and on several occasions, I found myself staring at what looked
like perfectly valid code, but XCode was throwing an error about variables not
being in scope, even though they appeared to be.  ChatGPT assured me my code was
correct, so I’d back out changes and redo them, trying to be sure I hadn’t
missed anything. Finally, I used XCode’s “Refactor” menu to rename a variable,
and it told me the variable it had renamed wasn’t in scope! I restarted XCode
and everything worked just fine after that. I had to restart XCode a few times
during this process, which slowed things down a bit.</p>

<h2><a name="mansplaining-as-a-service"></a>Mansplaining as a Service</h2>

<p>One thing thing that annoyed me about the app was that I would type in the name
of an item I wanted to buy and the item would be added, but it would
also be left in the text field. I wanted that field to be cleared every
time I hit “return.” The code looked like this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code>TextField(&quot;New item&quot;, text: $newItemName, onCommit: {
    if !newItemName.isEmpty {
        let newItem = ShoppingItem(name: newItemName, isChecked: false, frequency: 1)
        if !viewModel.addItem(newItem) {
            duplicateItemName = newItem.name
            showingDuplicateItemAlert = true
            fadeOutBackground = true

            // Start a timer to reset the fade-out effect after 10 seconds
            DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 5) {
                fadeOutBackground = false
                duplicateItemName = &quot;&quot;
            }
        }
        else {
            duplicateItemName = &quot;&quot;
            viewModel.applyLastSortAction()
        }
        newItemName = &quot;&quot;
    }
})
</code></pre></div>

<p>So I asked ChatGPT how to fix that. It confidently assured me that I merely
needed to add <code>newItemName = ""</code> at the end of the closure and the field would
be cleared. And then it said that since I already had that, my code was doing
what I wanted.</p>

<p>It was not doing what I wanted. I explained this to ChatGPT several times and it
repeated the same incorrect information several times. While <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/17/stack-overflow-cuts-28-of-its-staff/" target="_blank">StackOverflow is
slowing being killed by
AI</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, it
gave me the answer that ChatGPT could not. I needed to add this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code>.onSubmit {
    newItemName = &quot;&quot;
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Also, due to context length issues, ChatGPT kept “forgetting” that I was using
the latest version of the Swift programming language and was offering
deprecated versions of various code snippets. I finally gave up correcting
ChatGPT and made the corrections manually.</p>

<h1><a name="criticisms"></a>Criticisms</h1>

<h2><a name="you-dont-need-chatgpt"></a>You Don’t Need ChatGPT</h2>

<p><figure class="captioned">
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="/static/images/finger-moon.png" width="600" alt="A finger pointing at the moon. The fingernail is dirty.">
    <figcaption>Image by <a target="_blank" href="https://openai.com/dall-e-3">DALL-E</a> </figcaption>
    </div>
</figure></p>

<p>When I’ve shared bits of this story before, I’ve had people tell me I can just
use a spreadsheet or a pen and paper. I’m pointing at the moon and people are
telling me my fingernails are dirty. I don’t <em>want</em> a spreadsheet or a
pen and paper. I have my phone in my pocket and I want an app that
does exactly what I want and that’s what I now have.</p>

<p>What if I want to write an application that grabs <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html" target="_blank">The Astronomy Picture of the
Day</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> from NASA and sets that as my
phone’s background?</p>

<p>What if I want to write an application that grabs the headlines from
<a href="https://spacenews.com/" target="_blank">SpaceNews</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, presents them to me in a list, and let’s me
click through, but presents a short summary of each article instead (with a link
to the full article) instead of the entire text?</p>

<p>Spreadsheets or pen and paper aren’t going to give me those. I have a world of
possibilities that weren’t open to me before without months of learning a new
platform and programming language.</p>

<h2><a name="hallucinations"></a>Hallucinations</h2>

<p>I’m also constantly reminded about hallucinations, as if I wasn’t already aware
of them.</p>

<p>The thing is, hallucinations sort of come in two forms: hard and easy. The hard
hallucination is when it writes a lot of plausible text, with many “facts.” It
can take a lot of time to wade through all of those and verify them. Then,
maybe you need to verify your verifications. Just because Wikipedia says it’s so
doesn’t make it so.</p>

<p>The easy hallucination is when you can easily verify it. For code, you run the
code. Does it work? Most errors are very easy to spot.</p>

<p>One error that wasn’t easy to spot was that the frequency calculations were off.
I had suspected that early on, but since I don’t know Swift, I thought maybe
there was something unusual about how it worked. It was manual testing that
verified the calculations were off and ChatGPT fixed the issue quickly.</p>

<p>Of course, ChatGPT will also help you write tests for your application. I
confess that I didn’t do that, despite my being a huge testing fanatic. I wanted
to see how far I could push ChatGPT. For production code, even with ChatGPT,
you’ll want tests. ChatGPT <em>will</em> lose context and you’ll need those tests to
verify you haven’t broken anything.</p>

<p>However, there’s a thing to consider with “hallucinations” and code. What
happens when you write code? You write it, you run your tests, you find the
bugs, you fix them. It’s the same thing with language models, just much faster!</p>

<h2><a name="bad-code"></a>“Bad” Code</h2>

<p>This one is subtle and junior devs will easily miss it.</p>

<p>Much of our work in building large systems involves structuring code in such a
way that we can understand it later. Maintainability is important for humans,
but it’s less important for AI which can follow the code in ways that we cannot.</p>

<p>For example, can you see an issue with the following code? It displays two
buttons, side-by-side in a horizontal stack.</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code>HStack {
    Button(&quot;A to Z&quot;) {
        viewModel.sortAlpha()
        selectedSort = .alpha
        generateHapticFeedback()
    }
    .buttonStyle(CustomButtonStyle(isSelected: selectedSort == .alpha))
    .frame(width: 150) // Set a specific width for the button

    Button(&quot;Popular&quot;) {
        viewModel.sortFrequency()
        selectedSort = .frequency
        generateHapticFeedback()
    }
    .buttonStyle(CustomButtonStyle(isSelected: selectedSort == .frequency))
    .frame(width: 150) // Set a specific width for the button
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Did you see the problem? It’s not a bug. Many newer developers might not see an
issue, but you probably do: there’s a lot of duplicated code. Instead, you
want that to look similar to this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code>HStack {
    SortButton(title: &quot;A to Z&quot;, action: viewModel.sortAlpha, selectedSort: $selectedSort)
    SortButton(title: &quot;Popular&quot;, action: viewModel.sortFrequency, selectedSort: $selectedSort)
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>With the above, you can adjust the <code>SortButton</code> struct and have the behavior
apply to both of your sort buttons. Otherwise, you’ll have to manually keep
those two buttons in sync.</p>

<p>I also had imports in the code which I didn’t need and a couple of unused
methods generated, but how is a junior developer going to know that? From a
programmer’s standpoint, this is bad. From a business standpoint?  So what? “It
works; ship it,” will be the refrain. Bad code confuses humans more
than language models.</p>

<h1><a name="the-near-future"></a>The Near Future</h1>

<p>Programmers will be keep their jobs for the time being (unless you work at
StackOverflow), but Copilot and ChatGPT allow us to write code faster. When
working on a monolithic application, language models will help, but the massive
size means they won’t be able to have enough context, reducing their
effectiveness.</p>

<p>One clear use case for these tools is microservices. These are much smaller,
self-contained programs. Language models, even with a limited context, will
find them more tractable. With well-defined OpenAPI documents, microservices
will be quick and easy to develop. <a href="/articles/microservices-pros-and-cons.html">I’ve written about microservices
before</a> and <a href="/articles/dont-start-with-microservices.html">they do have their
challenges</a>, but combined with
language models, I can see development teams reaching heretofore unknown levels
of productivity.</p>

<h1><a name="the-far-future"></a>The Far Future</h1>

<p>Eventually ChatGPT is going to have native desktop integration. Given that it
already has <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/whisper" target="_blank">a speech recognition
model</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, you’ll be able to speak
to it. You can ask it to build an application and because it will have full
integration, it will be writing and running the code for you, seeing the errors
for itself and trying to automatically fix them. Because it will have full
access to the code, it can “look” for where the errors are coming from and
figure out for itself how to fix them, without you needing to remind it.</p>

<p>I expect it will be a few years before this is “production ready,” but with
this, the programmer’s ivory tower will finish its collapse.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-7"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span>. Our jobs will be going
away. The open question is whether we, like the Luddites, will find ourselves
without work and losing our homes,<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-8"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> or whether this will open the way for more complex work the AIs can’t
do (yet).</p>

<p><figure class="image">
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="/static/images/preferences-pane.png" width="600" alt="Just a few of the preferences available for iTerm 2">
    <figcaption>Just a few of the preferences available for iTerm 2 </figcaption>
    </div>
</figure></p>

<p>As a bonus, you will get exactly the applications <em>you</em> want. No more
bewildering array of preference selections. The app is for you, not for the
masses.  You won’t have to ask the app not to track. You won’t have annoying ads
until you pay for a premium service. Need a new feature? “Hey, ChatGPT, I need
you to change the novel writing app we created.”</p>

<p>We will finally have “programming for the masses.”</p>

<p>For all those who disagree, Dr. Matt Welsh would like to have a word.</p>

<div class="video-responsive">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JhCl-GeT4jw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>What will the code look like? In the early days of programming, we were setting
switches and pushing buttons on huge machines. Later, we were writing Fortran on
punch cards. Today, we have easy languages like Python and hard languages like
Rust, but consider even very difficult languages such as APL. The following is
<a href="https://aplwiki.com/wiki/John_Scholes%27_Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway’s Game of Life written in
APL</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code>life ← {⊃1 ⍵ ∨.∧ 3 4 = +/ +⌿ ¯1 0 1 ∘.⊖ ¯1 0 1 ⌽¨ ⊂⍵}
</code></pre></div>

<p>That’s still far easier than entering ones and zeros by toggling switches on a
room-sized beast.</p>

<p>Language models don’t need something that humans can read. They’ll be able to
write machine code directly. They might still use an intermediate representation
that can be easily translated to the machine code for a particular
architecture—presumably using a translator they’ve written. Or not. It’s hard to
predict the future.</p>

<p>Programs could potentially run faster and more reliably, but many people are not
going to feel comfortable with code they can’t verify, but this is where we’re
heading.</p>

<p>I also expect many applications will simply go away, being replaced by a
single language model which can handle this for us. “Hey, ChatGPT! Send an email
to mom, wishing her a happy birthday.” And ChatGPT will do that, probably
matching your conversational style.</p>

<h1><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1>

<p>The programming profession, as we practice is today, is dying. We may not see it
yet, but it is. And for all the cries of “programming language X is dying,” the
truth is that <em>all</em> programming languages are dying. We face an existential
threat, but I see many programmers denying this, insisting that they’re still
better than the language models. It’s true, they often are, but they’re slower
than the models and the models are getting better. More to the point, they’re
getting better faster than we are.</p>

<p>It’s possible there will still be a role for programmers, though. In the 80s, I
was tutoring college students in the C programming language. I met many
brilliant people who simply couldn’t <em>think</em> about programming the way
programmers do. Despite their intelligence, they couldn’t understand how to
structure programs, but lacking this skill, they had other skills that
programmers often don’t.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-9"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<p>This might spill over to prompt engineering. Note how detailed my original
prompt was.  If you go back to that prompt, note the last item on the list about
deleting items from storage when I remove them from my list.  If I didn’t
have that, I’d eventually risk filling up my storage over time, but not know
why. It’s little details like that which will keep programmers in business for a
while...until the AI learn to anticipate situations like this and ask us how to
address it.</p>

<p>“Prompt engineering” might be renamed “programming” in the future.
However, as language models increase in power, I expect that even this strength
might go away. If language models can ever incorporate <a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/philosophy/system-1-and-system-2-thinking" target="_blank">system 2
thinking</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
all bets are off. That might also be what leads us to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence" target="_blank">artificial general
intelligence</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>The AI boom today is like the internet boom in the 90s. There will be “bust”
periods as many AI companies offer products with no value. There will be
detractors who call AI “just a fad.” And AI will continue regardless. I’m both
excited and concerned by the future.</p>

	    <div>The Luddite rebellion ended in
1816, in part because “frame-breaking” (destroying the machines) was made a
capital offense and soldiers were shooting into crowds of
protestors.<br/><br/>Depending on the source, the economic damage to the
protestors wasn't fully corrected until sometimes between 1820 and 1850. That's
a long time to suffer, but the business owners were getting richer the entire
time.</div>
