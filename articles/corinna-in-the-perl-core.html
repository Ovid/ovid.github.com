<h1><a name="corinna-in-the-perl-core"></a>Corinna in the Perl Core!</h1>

<p>It’s been a years-long, painful process, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/14p3moz/perl_v5380_is_now_available/" target="_blank">with the release of Perl
v.5.38,0</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
the first bits of Corinna have been added to the Perl core. For those who have
not been following along, Corinna is a project to add a new object system to the
Perl core. Note that it’s not taking anything away from Perl; it’s adding a core
object system for better memory consumption, performance, and elegance.</p>

<p>If you don’t have v5.38.0, you can still install
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Feature::Compat::Class" target="_blank">Feature::Compat::Class</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> on
Perl v5.14.0 and above and get the same features.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/blob/master/rfc/mvp.md" target="_blank">MVP</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> for the Perl core
is in seven stages, three of which are done and one of which (convenience
attributes) is started (there is a <code>:param</code> attribute for <code>field</code>).</p>

<ol>
<li>Classes (done)</li>
<li>Inheritance (done)</li>
<li>Roles</li>
<li>Convenience attributes</li>
<li>Field initializer blocks (done)</li>
<li>MOP</li>
<li>Method modifiers</li>
</ol>

<p>We need at least six of those to be implemented to really have something decent
out of the box, but the MOP, while important, is not something that most OOP
developers reach for on a regular basis.</p>

<p><a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/perlclass" target="_blank">You can read what’s currently implemented at <code>perldoc
perlclass</code></a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, but here’s a 2D point
class using the existing features. We’ll make the default of the point be the
graph origin.</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code>class Point::2D {
    field $x :param = 0;
    field $y :param = 0;

    field $orig_x = $x;
    field $orig_y = $y;

    method x () { $x }
    method y () { $y }

    method reset () {
        $x = $orig_x;
        $y = $orig_y;
    }

    method move ($dx, $dy) {
        $x += $dx;
        $y += $dy;
    }

    method description () {
        return &quot;($x, $y)&quot;;
    }
}
my $point = Point::2D-&gt;new( x =&gt; 10, y =&gt; 20 );
$point-&gt;move( 5, 5 );
say $point-&gt;description; # (15, 25)
</code></pre></div>

<p>When the full Corinna is implemented, the <code>method x</code> and <code>method y</code> will be
replaced with:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code>    field $x :param :reader = 0;
    field $y :param :reader = 0;
</code></pre></div>

<h1><a name="the-teams"></a>The Teams</h1>

<p>Here’s a partial list of the main contributors and/or influencers to Corinna:</p>

<ul>
<li>Damian Conway</li>
<li>Dan Book (Grinnz)</li>
<li>Graham Knop (haarg)</li>
<li>Harald Jörg</li>
<li>Matt Trout</li>
<li>Paul Evans</li>
<li>Sawyer X</li>
<li>Stevan Little</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that Corinna was largely inspired by the work of Stevan Little. Damian
Conway was also a huge contributor, but he was mostly behind the scenes sharing
email with me and <a href="https://blogs.perl.org/users/damian_conway/" target="_blank">posting to
blogs.perl.org</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>;</p>

<p>Sawyer X’s main contribution was being the pumpking who encouraged me to stop
trying to implement Corinna, but instead focusing on building something great
without worrying about the current limitations of Perl.</p>

<p>Paul Evans is doing the actual implementation work and he’s doing a fantastic
job.</p>

<p>The others (not to slight them, I can’t remember <em>all</em> the details of a
multi-year project) were also huge contributors. They helped suss out design
flaws, called me on my bullshit, and helped me understand the limitations of
what we were trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>It’s also worth noting that due to this team effort, Corinna is <em>not</em> what I
wanted. I wanted more. Much more. But it wasn’t just about trimming Corinna down
to what P5P would accept, it was also vetoing many of my ideas about what I
thought <em>should</em> be in Corinna. I was wrong about a lot of things and I’m sure
I’m right about about some others, but the team effort is what made Corinna what
it is today and I’m immensely grateful for that.</p>

<h1><a name="other-languages"></a>Other Languages</h1>

<p>In the process of developing the Corinna MVP, many other languages were looked
at. I was particularly curious about <a href="https://beta.cs.au.dk/" target="_blank">Beta</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, but there
was nothing that fit. I also looked at Smalltalk, Java, Raku, Python, Eiffel,
and Ruby (and probably others I’m forgetting right now). There are many
interesting ideas, but given that we were trying to
get something that fit Perl, the biggest influences were Raku, Moo/se, and yes,
Java. Primarily, I was interested in protected methods and inner classes, but
the former seemed problematic and the latter wasn’t something appropriate for
the MVP. However, reading about OOP design (so many examples are in Java),
helped quite a bit with Corinna.</p>

<h1><a name="what-were-losing"></a>What We’re Losing</h1>

<p>There are, of course, trade-offs in something this huge.</p>

<h2><a name="you-cant-violate-encapsulation"></a>You Can’t Violate Encapsulation</h2>

<p>The biggest concern amongst developers is that we can no longer violate
encapsulation (well, you can via the MOP, but it will be more work, as it should
be. Emergency patches sometimes require violating encapsulation).</p>

<p>However, I don’t know many developers who can define encapsulation. People keep
saying it’s about hiding state, but that’s not true. It’s about hiding state
<em>and</em> process because the two are intimately linked in classes. If you can
change the state without going through the interface, you have no guarantees the
process is correct. That’s a bad thing.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this has been well-understood for decades, so there’s a wealth of
information about proper OOP design on how handle this. I expect there will be
changes to Corinna to help with this, but we don’t know what they are yet.</p>

<h2><a name="no-multiple-inheritance"></a>No Multiple Inheritance</h2>

<p>To my surprise, no one on the design team strongly argued against this change.
There were discussions, but nothing too serious. There are many OOP languages
which do not allow multiple inheritance and it’s not a big deal.  In fact, there
are some OOP language which don’t allow inheritance at all.</p>

<p>Most languages which forbid multiple inheritance offer some sort of alternative.
In our case, it’s roles.</p>

<h2><a name="no-inheriting-from-blessed-classes"></a>No Inheriting from Blessed Classes</h2>

<p>Your new Corinna class cannot inherit from anything not declared as a <code>class</code>.
This was a slightly contentious issue, but there are simply too many
differences. Corinna doesn’t allow you to “reach inside” and manipulate the
data. Corinna is single-inheritance, so it’s unclear how that would have worked
with classes allowing multiple inheritance. And ultimately, we’d like Corinna to
have the option of having a different <code>UNIVERSAL::</code> base class, offering
different capabilities.</p>

<p>This, of course, means that developers will have to understand “composition over
inheritance.”  This is a good thing.</p>

<h1><a name="what-were-gaining"></a>What We’re Gaining</h1>

<p>Object-oriented programming will be “first class” in Perl, not just a hacked on
solution. Methods and subroutines will no longer be the same thing.  We’ll have
private methods. We already have a much more concise, and clear way of writing
classes. Companies using the <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Object::Pad" target="_blank">Object::Pad</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
prototype have reported a 10% reduction in CPU usage and that’s <em>without</em>
optimization. We have have potential for a much more efficient implementation of
objects than we’ve had before.</p>

<h1><a name="the-principle-of-parsimony"></a>The Principle of Parsimony</h1>

<p>Given all of the above, I have confession to make about the new <code>class</code> syntax
for Perl: we made a mistake. It’s a whopping huge mistake.</p>

<p>The problem is that we don’t know what that mistake is. There’s probably more
than one of them.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the README of the Corinna repository is a section entitled <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor#principle-of-parsimony" target="_blank">The Principle of
Parsimony</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, it states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many things in the proposal are deliberately restrictive, such as Corinna
  only allowing single inheritance. This is to allow Corinna to be cautious in
  not promising too much. If we later find this too restrictive, we can allow
  multiple inheritance. However, if we start with multiple inheritance and
  discover we don’t need or want multiple inheritance, we would break existing
  code by taking it away.</p>
  
  <p>Any proposals to change the RFC must consider the principle of parsimony.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The design team really should have highlighted this more because <strong>it’s the
single most important thing</strong> (outside of the new <code>class</code> syntax itself).</p>

<hr />

<p>Most people seem happy with the changes. They’re new. They’re exciting. They’re
a step towards a new future for the language.</p>

<p>Some people are unhappy. Some are unhappy for reasons that are, well, silly.
Case in point: I’ve had a developer angrily tell me they’re nearing retirement
and they don’t want to keep up with a bunch of changes in the Perl language
(more than one, but the other wasn’t quite so strident in this position).</p>

<p>Some are unhappy because Corinna didn’t go far enough.</p>

<p>Some are unhappy because Corinna has gone too far.</p>

<p>Others are unhappy because <em>« insert reason here »</em>.</p>

<p>I get that. I really do.</p>

<p>So why doesn’t Corinna have multiple inheritance? Because if it did and it’s a
mistake, we can’t easily walk it back without breaking existing code.</p>

<p>So why doesn’t Corinna allow inheriting from non-Corinna objects? Because if it
did and it’s a mistake, we can’t easily walk it back without breaking existing
code.</p>

<p>So why doesn’t Corinna have native support for <code>field</code> (attribute) builders
like Moo/se? Because if it did and it’s a mistake, we can’t easily walk it back
without breaking existing code.</p>

<p>The counter-argument is that the new <code>class</code> syntax is experimental and we
should have that freedom. My counter-counter-argument is that I know of
large code-bases which haven’t upgraded past 5.26 because <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/5.28.0/perldelta#Subroutine-attribute-and-signature-order" target="_blank">5.28
swapped the order of attributes and signatures
bodies</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>Companies can and do rely on experimental features.</p>

<p>The design team agreed (generally) to follow the Principle of Parsimony to
ensure we didn’t paint ourselves into corners more than we already had. We
expect that in the real-world, people are going to make compelling arguments
for changes based on limitations they discover.  We know mistakes are going to
be found. We’d like to see if those are mistakes in our design, or mistakes in
how people (ab)use OOP code in Perl.</p>

<p>I might add that the Principle of Parsimony hasn’t been an absolute, even in
the design stage. For example, originally Corinna required a postfix block:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code>class Foo {
    ...
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>The extremely tight scoping of the postfix block would make it much harder for
Corinna keywords to bleed into an unwanted scope. I argued for that, but I was
overruled. The postfix block is not required.</p>

<p>So please keep this in mind about future discussions of the new <code>class</code> syntax.</p>

<p>We made mistakes. We don’t know what they are. We worked very hard to try to
ensure that fixing those mistakes means extending Corinna, not breaking it.</p>

<h1><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Corinna, for now, is experimental and incomplete. The biggest obstacle for its
adoption is likely to be the fact that developers are going to have to learn new
ways of programming. The most annoying might be that <code>field</code> variables aren’t
available in subclasses (encapsulation!), so you’ll find it convenient to make a
public accessor to fetch this data. There’s a similar issue with roles. The Java
notion of <code>protected</code> methods is not available.</p>

<p>There are ways we could potentially address these issues, but we need to see
what people are doing with Corinna and what their real pain points are.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the <code>Object::Pad</code> project shows that the new approach plays quite
well with existing code, so we are pretty sure we have the basics right, but we
don’t know what we don’t know.</p>

<p>Interesting times are ahead.</p>
