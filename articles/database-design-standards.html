<h1><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>

<p>When moving from project to project, it’s unfortunate that we find that there
are no consistent standards on database design, despite SQL having been around
for decades. I suspect that much of this is because <a href="/articles/how-databases-can-hurt-your-startup.html">most
developers don’t understand database design</a>. In fact, with my years of
hiring developers, only a handful of times have I met developers who can
properly normalize a database. To be fair, normalization can be hard, but most
developers I’ve interviewed, even excellent ones with strong SQL skills, don’t
have database design skills.</p>

<p>But this article isn’t about database normalization. If you want to learn
more, here’s a short talk I gave which explains the basics.</p>

<div class="video-responsive">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y1tcbhWLiUM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>Instead, when you have a working database, the question we want to know is
“what standards can we apply which make it easier to <em>use</em> that database?” If
these standards were to be widely adopted, databases would be easier to use
because you wouldn’t have to learn and remember a new set of standards every
time you work with a new database.</p>

<h1><a name="camelcasenames-or-underscore-names"></a>CamelCaseNames or underscore_names?</h1>

<p>Let’s get this out of the way quickly. I routinely see database examples
online where we see table names like <code>CustomerOrders</code> or <code>customer_orders</code>.
Which should you use? You probably want to use whatever standard is already in
place, but if you’re creating a new database, I recommend <code>using_undercores</code>
for accessibility. The words “under value” have a different meaning from the
word “undervalue”, but the former, with underscores, is always <code>under_value</code>,
while the latter is <code>undervalue</code>. With CamelCase, it’s <code>Undervalue</code> versus
<code>UnderValue</code> which, since SQL is case-insensitive, are identical. Further, if
you have vision problems and are constantly playing around with fonts and
sizes to distinguish words, the underscores are <em>much</em> easier to read.</p>

<p>As a side problem, CamelCase is anecdotally harder to read for people for whom
English isn’t their first language.</p>

<p>That being said, this is a personal preference and not a strong
recommendation.</p>

<h1><a name="plural-or-singular-tables"></a>Plural or Singular Tables?</h1>

<p>There’s long been a huge debate amongst experts in database theory about
whether or not database tables should be singular (<code>customer</code>) or plural
(<code>customers</code>). Without going into the theory, let me cut the Gordian Knot with
a healthy dose of pragmatism: plural table names are less likely to conflict
with reserved keywords.</p>

<p>Do you have users? SQL has a <code>user</code> reserved word. Do you want a table of
constraints? <code>constraint</code> is a reserved word. Is <code>audit</code> a reserved word but
you want an <code>audit</code> table? By simply using the <em>plural</em> form of nouns, most
reserved words won’t cause you grief when you’re writing SQL. Even PostgreSQL,
which has an excellent SQL parser, has been tripped up when encountering a
<code>user</code> table.</p>

<p>Just use plural names and you’re far less likely to have a collision.</p>

<h1><a name="dont-name-the-id-column-id"></a>Don’t name the ID column “id”</h1>

<p>This is a sin I’ve been guilty of for years. When working with a client in
Paris, I had a DBA complain when I named my id columns <code>id</code> and I thought he
was being pedantic. After all, the <code>customers.id</code> column is unambiguous, but
<code>customers.customer_id</code> is repeating information.</p>

<p>And later I had to debug the following:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-sql">SELECT thread.*
  FROM email thread
  JOIN email selected      ON selected.id = thread.id
  JOIN character recipient ON recipient.id = thread.recipient_id
  JOIN station_area sa     ON sa.id = recipient.id
  JOIN station st          ON st.id = sa.id
  JOIN star origin         ON origin.id = thread.id
  JOIN star destination    ON destination.id = st.id
LEFT JOIN route
       ON ( route.from_id = origin.id
            AND 
            route.to_id = destination.id )
 WHERE selected.id                = ?
   AND ( thread.sender_id         = ? 
         OR ( thread.recipient_id = ?
              AND ( origin.id = destination.id
                    OR ( route.distance IS NOT NULL
                         AND
                         now() &gt;= thread.datesent
                         + ( route.distance * interval '30 seconds' )
        ))))
ORDER BY datesent ASC, thread.parent_id ASC
</code></pre></div>

<p>Do you see the problem? If the SQL had used full id names, such as <code>email_id</code>,
<code>star_id</code>, and <code>station_id</code>, the bugs would have stood out like a sore thumb
<em>while I was typing out this SQL</em>, not later when I was trying to figure out
both what I did wrong and why I don’t drink as much as I should.</p>

<p>And by request of a few people who couldn’t see the errors, here’s the SQL
after it’s corrected. It’s very clear that “star_id” and “email_id”, or
“station_id” and “station_area_id” are probably not valid comparisons. As
previously mentioned, if SQL had a decent type system, this SQL would not even
have compiled.</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-sql">SELECT thread.*
  FROM email thread
  JOIN email selected      ON selected.email_id      = thread.email_id
  JOIN character recipient ON recipient.character_id = thread.recipient_id
  -- station_area_id = character_id is probably wrong
  JOIN station_area sa     ON sa.station_area_id     = recipient.character_id
  -- station_id = station_area_id is probably wrong
  JOIN station st          ON st.station_id          = sa.station_area_id
  -- star_id = email_id is probably wrong
  JOIN star origin         ON origin.star_id         = thread.email_id
  JOIN star destination    ON destination.star_id    = st.star_id
LEFT JOIN route
       ON ( route.from_id = origin.star_id
            AND 
            route.to_id = destination.star_id )
 WHERE selected.email_id          = ?
   AND ( thread.sender_id         = ? 
         OR ( thread.recipient_id = ?
              AND ( origin.star_id = destination.star_id
                    OR ( route.distance IS NOT NULL
                         AND
                         now() &gt;= thread.datesent
                         + ( route.distance * interval '30 seconds' )
        ))))
ORDER BY datesent ASC, thread.parent_id ASC
</code></pre></div>

<p>Do yourself a favor and use full names for IDs. You can thank me later.</p>

<h1><a name="column-naming"></a>Column Naming</h1>

<p>As much as possible, name columns very descriptively. For example, a
<code>temperature</code> column doesn’t make sense for this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-sql">SELECT name, 'too cold'
  FROM areas
 WHERE temperature &lt; 32;  
</code></pre></div>

<p>I live in France and for anyone here, 32 would be “too hot”. Instead, name that
column <code>fahrenheit</code>.</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-sql">SELECT name, 'too cold'
  FROM areas
 WHERE fahrenheit &lt; 32;  
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now it’s completely unambiguous.</p>

<p>Also, when you have foreign key constraints, you should name the columns on
each side of the constraint identically, if possible.  For example, consider
this perfectly reasonable, sane, SQL.</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-sql">SELECT *
  FROM some_table       s
  JOIN some_other_table o
    ON o.owner = s.person_id;
</code></pre></div>

<p>That looks sane. There’s really nothing wrong with it. But when you consult the
table definition, you discover that <code>some_other_table.owner</code> has a foreign key
constraint against <code>companies.company_id</code>. That SQL is, in fact, wrong. Had
you used identical names:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-sql">SELECT *
  FROM some_table       s
  JOIN some_other_table o
    ON o.company_id = s.person_id;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now it’s immediately clear that we have a bug and you can see it on a single
line of code and don’t have to go consult the table definition.</p>

<p>However, it should be noted that this isn’t always possible. If you have a
table with a source warehouse and a destination warehouse, you might want a
<code>source_id</code> and a <code>destination_id</code> to compare with your <code>warehouse_id</code>. Naming
them <code>source_warehouse_id</code> and <code>destination_warehouse_id</code> will make this
easier to follow.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that in the example above, <code>owner</code> is more descriptive
of the intent than <code>company_id</code>. If you feel this is likely to cause
confusion, you can name the column <code>owning_company_id</code>. That can still embed
the intent of the column in the name while giving you a strong hint as to its
intent.</p>

<h1><a name="avoid-null-values"></a>Avoid NULL Values</h1>

<p>Saving the best (or is it worst?) for last! This is a tip that many
experienced database developers are aware of, but sadly, it doesn’t get
repeated often enough: don’t allow <code>NULL</code> values in your database without an
excellent reason.</p>

<p>This will take a bit of time because this is an important, but somewhat
complicated topic. First, we’ll discuss the theory, then we’ll discuss their
impact on database design, and we’ll finish up with a practical example of the
serious problems <code>NULL</code> values cause. </p>

<h2><a name="database-types"></a>Database Types</h2>

<p>In the database, we have various data <em>types</em>, such as <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>JSON</code>,
<code>DATETIME</code>, and so on. A type is associated with a column and any value added
should conform to the type associated with that column.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<p>But what’s a type? A type is a name, a set of allowed values, and a set of
allowed operations. This helps us avoid unwanted behavior. For example, in
Java, what happens if you try to compare a string and an integer?</p>

<pre><code>CustomerAccount.java:5: error: bad operand types for binary operator '&gt;'
        if ( current &gt; threshhold ) {
                   ^
  first type:  String
  second type: int
</code></pre>

<p>Even if you can’t see by glancing at the code that <code>current &gt; threshhold</code> is
comparing incompatible types, the compiler will trap this for you.</p>

<p>Ironically, databases, which store your data—and are your last line of defense
against data corruption—are terrible at types! I mean, really, really bad at
them. For example, if your <code>customers</code> table has an integer surrogate key, you
can do this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-sql">SELECT name, birthdate
  FROM customers
 WHERE customer_id &gt; weight;
</code></pre></div>

<p>That, of course, doesn’t make a lick of sense and in a sane world would be a
compile-time error.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-2"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> Many programming languages make it trivial to
trap type errors like this but databases make it hard.</p>

<p>But that’s not how databases generally behave, quite possibly because when <a href="https://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt" target="_blank">the first SQL
standard was released in 1992</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, computers were slow beasts and anything that
complicated the implementation would undoubtedly have made databases slow.</p>

<p>And here’s where the <code>NULL</code> value comes into all of this. There is one place
where the SQL standard got this right and that’s with the <code>IS NULL</code> and <code>IS
NOT NULL</code> predicates. Since the <code>NULL</code> value is, by definition, unknown, you
can’t possibly have operators defined for it. That’s why <code>IS NULL</code> and <code>IS NOT
NULL</code> exist instead of <code>= NULL</code> and <code>!= NULL</code>. And any <code>NULL</code> comparison
results in a new <code>NULL</code> value.</p>

<p>If that sounds strange, it becomes <em>much</em> easier if you say “unknown” instead
of <code>NULL</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strike>NULL</strike> Unknown comparisons result in <strike>NULL</strike>
  unknown values.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, now it makes perfect sense!</p>

<h2><a name="what-does-a-null-value-mean"></a>What does a NULL value mean?</h2>

<p>Now that we have the tiniest amount of type theory under our belt, let’s
examine the practical implications.</p>

<p>You need to pay a $500 bonus to all employees who earn more than $50K a year
in salary. So you write the following SQL.</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-sql">SELECT employee_number, name
  FROM employees
 WHERE salary &gt; 50000;
</code></pre></div>

<p>And you just got fired because your boss earns more than $50K but their salary
isn’t in the database (their <code>employees.salary</code> column is <code>NULL</code>) and the
comparison operator can’t compare a <code>NULL</code> with 50000.</p>

<p>And just why is that value <code>NULL</code>? Maybe their salary is confidential. Maybe
the information hasn’t arrived yet. Maybe they’re a consultant and they’re not
paid a salary. Maybe they’re paid hourly and are not salaried. There are
<em>plenty</em> of reasons why that data might not be available.</p>

<p>The existence or non-existence of data in a column suggests that it depends on
something <em>other</em> than just the primary key and your database is possibly
denormalized. Thus, columns which might have <code>NULL</code> values are good candidates
for creating new tables. In this case, you might have tables for <code>salaries</code>,
<code>hourly_rates</code>, <code>none_of_your_business</code> and so on.  You’ll still get fired for
blindly joining on salaries and missing that your boss doesn’t have one, but
at least your database is starting to present you with enough information to
suggest that there’s more to the problem than just a salary.</p>

<p>And yes, this was a silly example, but it leads to the final nail in the coffin.</p>

<h2><a name="nulls-lead-to-logical-impossibilities"></a>NULLs lead to logical impossibilities</h2>

<p>You might have some sense that I’m being a bit pedantic about <code>NULL</code> values,
but we have one final example and it’s caused much real-world grief.</p>

<p>Years ago I was in London working for a domain registrar and trying to figure
out why a somewhat messy 80 line SQL query was returning incorrect data. There
was a particular case where data absolutely should have been returned, but
wasn’t. I’m embarassed to say that it took me about a day to track it down and
it was a combination of a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>I had used an <code>OUTER JOIN</code></li>
<li>Those can easily generate <code>NULL</code> values</li>
<li><code>NULL</code> values can cause your SQL to give you incorrect answers</li>
</ul>

<p>That last statement is something most database developers are unaware of, so
let’s look at an example <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Database-Depth-Relational-Theory-Practitioners/dp/0596100124/" target="_blank">Database In Depth</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> by C.J. Date. First, a trivial schema with two tables.</p>

<hr />

<p><code>suppliers</code></p>

<div class="container">
  <table class="u-full-width">
    <tr class="u-full-width"><th>supplier_id</th><th>city</th></tr>
    <tr class="u-full-width"><td>s1</td><td>London</td></tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p><code>parts</code></p>

<div class="container">
  <table class="u-full-width">
    <tr class="u-full-width"><th>part_id</th><th>city</th></tr>
    <tr class="u-full-width"><td>p1</td><td><code>NULL</code></td></tr>
  </table>
</div>

<hr />

<p>Those should be pretty clear and it’s harder to get a simpler example.</p>

<p>The following, of course, returns <code>p1</code>.</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-sql">SELECT part_id
  FROM parts;
</code></pre></div>

<p>But what about the following?</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-sql">SELECT part_id
  FROM parts
 WHERE city = city;
</code></pre></div>

<p>That returns no rows since you cannot compare a <code>NULL</code> value with anything—not
even another <code>NULL</code> and not even the <em>same</em> <code>NULL</code>.  That seems odd because
the city for every given row must the be the same city, even if we don’t know
it, right? And that leads us to the following. What does this return?  Try to
work out the answer before reading it below.</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-sql">SELECT s.supplier_id, p.part_id
  FROM suppliers s, parts p
 WHERE p.city &lt;&gt; s.city
    OR p.city &lt;&gt; 'Paris';
</code></pre></div>

<p>We get no rows because we can’t compare a <code>NULL</code> city (<code>p.city</code>) and thus
neither branch of the <code>WHERE</code> clause can evaluate to true.</p>

<p>However, we know that the unknown city either <strong>is Paris</strong> or it <strong>is not
Paris</strong>.  If it’s Paris, the first condition is true (<code>&lt;&gt; 'London'</code>).  If it’s
not Paris, the second condition is true (<code>&lt;&gt; 'Paris'</code>).  Thus, the <code>WHERE</code>
clause must be true, but it’s not, leading to SQL which generates logically
impossible results.</p>

<p><em>That</em> was the bug which bit me in London. Any time you write SQL which can
generate or include <code>NULL</code> values you run the risk of having SQL lie to you.
It doesn’t happen often, but when it does, it’s devilishly hard to track down.</p>

<h1><a name="summary"></a>Summary</h1>

<ul>
<li>Use <code>underscore_names</code> instead of <code>CamelCaseNames</code></li>
<li>Table names should be plural</li>
<li>Spell out id fields (<code>item_id</code> instead of <code>id</code>)</li>
<li>Don’t use ambiguous column names</li>
<li>When possible, name foreign key columns the same as the columns they refer to</li>
<li>Add <code>NOT NULL</code> to all column definitions, when possible</li>
<li>Avoid writing SQL which can generate <code>NULL</code> values, when possible</li>
</ul>

<p>While not perfect, the above database design guidelines will make your
database world a better place.</p>
