<p>The following is a true story, but with names changed.</p>

<p>When I work with clients to build software, I take the usual steps
of understanding their needs, gathering requirements, learning about
their customers, and so on. At this point I have a model on paper of
roughly what the software is intended to do, so they get surprised
when I immediately turn to database design.</p>

<p>"Who care about database design? What about mockups? What about
workflows?"</p>

<p>Let me tell you about "Bob's Luxury Goods." I worked for this
company many years ago and they had a retail store selling ... you
guessed it ...  luxury goods. They'd ask all customers for a billing
address and if they had a different delivery address. At the database
level, they had a "one-to-many" relationship between customers and
addresses.</p>

<p>That was their first problem. A customer's partner might come into
Bob's and order something and if the address was entered correctly it
would be flagged as "in use" and we had to use a different address or
<em>deliberately</em> enter a typo. Fortunately, addresses were
case-sensitive, so many people had UPPER-CASE ADDRESSES.</p>

<p>We should have had a many-to-many relationship between customers
and addresses so we could handle the case where more than one person
would share the same address, but we didn't. Further, I was never
allocated the time to fix the database because it was "cheaper" to
remove the restriction on "flagged" addresses and allow a
<em>duplicate</em> address to be used.</p>

<p>Naturally, being a luxury goods company, we had many repeat
customers and sometimes they would move and if we didn't find the
duplicate address, or the address with the "typo", we might update the
address for one partner, but not the other. That was a headache, but
it didn't happen frequently enough for management to worry about
it.</p>

<p>That's when the marketing department had a brilliant, inexpensive
idea. You see, we periodically did mass mailings of special events to
our customers. Since we had the software to do mass mailings, why not
import a mailing list of all addresses in high net worth areas and
mail <em>everyone</em> about upcoming special events? So the company
went ahead and bought a database with all of these addresses, but
forgot to mention to me that I was supposed to implement this.</p>

<p>Except that every address record had the customer id embedded in
it, so we couldn't enter an address without a customer.</p>

<p>"Curtis," they said, "just enter a dummy customer called
'Occupant' and attach all addresses to that."</p>

<p>Except you couldn't enter a customer without an order.</p>

<p>Except you couldn't enter an order without at least one item on
it.</p>

<p>Except you couldn't enter an item unless it was listed in
inventory.</p>

<p>Except that reserved the "inventory" item and made it
unavailable.</p>

<p>Except, except, except ...</p>

<p>It came down to trying to create a fake customer, with a fake
order, with a fake item, with a fake item category, with a "paid"
invoice, with exceptions sprinkled throughout the codebase to handle
all of these special cases and probably more that I no longer
remember.</p>

<p>Then, and only then, could I write the code to provide "generic"
mass mailings. Management decided it was easier to hire an outside
company to handle the mailing list for them.</p>

<p>If they had simply had a proper database design up front, they
could have reused their existing system with little trouble.</p>

<p>That's what bad database design costs you and why I usually start
with that before writing my software.</p>

<p>Note: if you're not familiar with database design, here's a talk I
give where I make it fairly simple to understand. I mostly avoid big
words.</p>
