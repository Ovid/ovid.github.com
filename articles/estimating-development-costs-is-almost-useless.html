<article>



<p>I may not win many friends by commenting on the emperor's nudity, but let's
charge ahead anyway. I am not a clever man.</p>

<p>Possibly you've not heard of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_W._Hubbard"
target="_blank">Douglas Hubbard</a>. If you're interested at all in estimating
the value of IT projects, his works should be required reading. In fact, <a
href="https://www.soa.org/Education/Exam-Req/Syllabus-Study-Materials/exam-book-list.aspx"
target="_blank">his books are required reading for the Society of
Actuaries</a> if you want to pass their exams and become an actuary. Douglas
Hubbard is a clever man.</p>

<p>But we'll come back to him in a moment.</p>

<p>If there's one key thing I've learned in consulting, it's that potential
clients who start discussions by talking about building value for their
customers have usually been better clients than those who start conversations
with "what's your rate?" Why? Because the "what's your rate" clients are
focused on controlling costs, not building value. I've found that their
approach problems is different and those who are paying more attention to
minimizing risk than maximizing value simply have different ideas about how to
approach a project.</p>

<p>And you know what? I get it. If you want to go out to dinner and you only
have £15 in your pocket, you're probably not going to a fancy restaurant. You
just might grab a pint at a pub and hit a kebab shop after. Budget constraints
are real.</p>

<p>But curiously, while development costs on a project are one of the first
things we look at, they're also one of the worst metrics you can use to judge
the value of a project. It's part of a problem that Hubbard refers to as the
<a
href="https://www.cio.com/article/2438748/it-organization/the-it-measurement-inversion.html"
target="_blank">IT Measurement Inversion</a>. Specifically:</p>

<blockquote>The variables having the greatest impact on project success
are the variables we measure the least.</blockquote>

<p>So what sort of variables are there? There are the ongoing development and
maintenance costs when the project is delivered. There are marketing costs.
There are costs to have your people learn the new system. And so on.  The
costs are myriad and complex, but if we're going to judge the <em>value</em>
of a new system, which variables matter the most?  Those are the ones we
should be focusing on.</p>

<div class="video-responsive">
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w4fHGTsZZD8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


<p>Hubbard's work will guide you here. In particular, you might want to
consider his book <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Measure-Anything-Intangibles-Business/dp/1118539273"
target="_blank">How to Measure Anything</a> (that's not an affiliate link, by
the way), where he teaches you how to break problems down to <em>things that
can be measured</em> and <em>how to measure them</em>. You'll learn quite a
bit about statistical analysis and running <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method" target="_blank">Monte
Carlo simulations</a>. In fact, one of the things you'll learn is that of the
various techniques which have been developed to estimate project success,
Monte Carlo simulations win hands down.</p>

<p>In fact, Monte Carlo simulations are so powerful that Hubbard talks about
research at NASA showing that, for over 100 projects, the accountants
outperformed the subject matter experts (scientists and engineers) on project
estimates because the accountants used Monte Carlo simulations rather than
other methodologies.</p>

<p>But for the purposes of our article, the key takeaway is that Hubbard has
done a lot of this work for you and has nailed down what your real risks are.
And it's almost intuitive once you think of it. Let's start with the most
important.</p>

<blockquote>The greatest risk to project success is whether or not it will
be canceled.</blockquote>

<p>That seems so brain-dead obvious that it's almost insulting to say, but
when was the last time you quantified that risk? When was the last time you
looked at the potential value of a large project and said "there's a 25% that
this project will be canceled" and then factored that into your risk
estimates? It's the single most important variable, but most people ignore it!
Can you imagine running a company and discovering your managers are repeatedly
ignoring the most valuable information at their disposal?</p>

<p>The next most important variable is system utilization. This is actually
complex and includes how fast your product will roll out, whether people will
use it, their rate of adoption, and so on. Again, this seems so obvious given
20/20 hindsight. Sure, your project took six months to develop instead of
three, but customers will be using it for many years. When it's put that way,
it's obvious that estimating system utilization is more valuable than
estimating development costs. But people still ignore it.</p>

<p>So let's look at development costs.</p>

<p>Of <em>course</em> you have to factor in development costs; I'd be insane
to suggest otherwise. You have a budget and when you're looking at backing
your project with Oracle or PostgreSQL, most of the time you find that Oracle
isn't a terribly cost-effective solution. So yes, costs are important, but
consider this: if the first version of Amazon's code cost twice as much to
develop, Jeff Bezos would probably still be insanely rich. Uber would still be
dominating their space. Facebook would still be selling your pesonal data to
dodgy companies. I can confidently say that because these companies are
providing real <em>value</em> to people (you might disagree about Facebook,
but <a
href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/"
target="_blank">I can offer you 2.32 billion rebuttals</a>). The fact that
these projects weren't canceled and are being used far, far outweighs the
initial project costs. Or to restate all of this:</p>

<blockquote>Initial development costs are incurred once. Your revenue
stream is continuous. That's why development costs are less
important.</blockquote>

<p>"But Curtis, I don't know how to do Monte Carlo simulations or estimate
projected system utilization!"</p>

<p>Well ... that's actually a fair point. These articles are intended, if
nothing else, to be practical.</p>

<p>Since the two most importance variables in project success are the odds of
it being canceled and system utilization, we need to reduce the risk of each
of those. How do we do that?</p>

<p>Simply put, you go lean/agile. Figure out the smallest possible work you
can do which would add value and build that. Instead of a year-long project,
you have a crazy one month race to get a simple prototype in front of your
customers. If it turns out your customers have zero interest in your "Recycled
Food" project, it's better to find out after a month instead of a year.</p>

<p>But let's say there's some interest. What now? Well, you've greatly reduced
the chance of project cancelation because it looks viable, so you need to
focus on system utilization. Amongst the key factors, getting customers to
actually use the damned thing is incredibly important.  You will be amazed at
the ideas they come up with and the feedback they give you. As you push
forward, you address customer concerns and have a lower risk of building
features on top of things they say aren't working. You're constantly pushing
new versions of the product in front of your customers and iterating based on
their feedback. Every step of the way, you're improving your project based on
customer behavior, not your hunches or market research.</p>

<p>This, incidentally, is why <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">Lean
Startups</a> are such a powerful movement in business today. They assume
they're not canceling their entire business, so they need to maximize system
utilization. That means rolling the product out quickly and immediately
responding to customer feedback. By doing this, assuming your product isn't
canceled, you've now reduced the single greatest risk your project faces.</p>
