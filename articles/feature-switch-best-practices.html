<h1><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>

<p>One of the best things to come out of the modern DevOps movement is the
aggressive push for “feature switches.” At <a href="https://allaroundtheworld.fr/" target="_blank">All Around the
World</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, we strongly recommend them for our
clients and sometimes we implement them, but I’m still surprised that many
companies don’t use them. They’re dead-simple to build and they’re a powerful
tool for site reliability. Unfortunately, many articles discuss how to build
them or use them, but best practices are neglected. So we’ll skip the
implementation and instead focus on using feature switches effectively.</p>

<p><em>Note: the discussion below refers to “sites” because this is in the context of
websites. Obviously, it doesn’t have to be.</em></p>

<p>A couple of decades ago when I was working for a small web-development firm in
Portland, Oregon, we released a new version of our software that had a critical
bug in a new feature. The bug was serious enough that it took down the entire
web site. We had to revert to an earlier version (from CVS, the good ‘ol days!)
and redeploy the web site. Our largest client’s site was down for an hour and
that was not good. Had we used feature switches, we could simply have turned the
feature off and the client might not have even noticed.</p>

<p>Note that you don’t need to implement everything I suggest in your first pass;
you just need to get up and running and comfortable with feature switches. Once
you do, you can better understand the additional tooling support needed for your
use case.</p>

<h1><a name="programming-a-new-feature"></a>Programming A New Feature</h1>

<p>For the developer, using feature switches is straight-forward. Imagine that you
always show a list of categories for products you sell, but you’re fetching it
from the database every time. Developers argue for caching the list, but
sometimes it changes and arguments over cache invalidation stall development.
Finally, an agreement is reached, but you don’t want to roll the new
functionality out blindly, so you use a feature switch. Here’s some pseudo-code
in Perl.</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">my $categories;
if ( feature_on('cached_categories') ) {
    $categories = $cache-&gt;category_names;
}
else {
    $categories = $app-&gt;category_names;
}
</code></pre></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Side note: the above is shown for simplicity. In reality, <code>$app</code> variables
  often imply some kind of global state and if it’s mutable, that can be
  dangerous, but we’re keeping it simple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the above, if the <code>cached_categories</code> feature is on, we fetch features from
the cache. If it’s not, we fetch it from the database. There are numerous ways
this can be done on the front-end, but we’ll skip those for the purposes of this
article.</p>

<p>Why would you bother to use a feature switch for the above? You’ve tested it.
The customer won’t see a difference. You <em>know</em> it works. Right?</p>

<p>No, you don’t. What if your cache invalidation doesn’t work quite as expected?
What if your cache isn’t loaded? What if your brand-new caching system
isn’t as reliable as you thought and you actually need the following?</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">my $categories;
if ( feature_on('cached_categories') ) {
    $categories = $cache-&gt;category_names || $app-&gt;category_names;
}
else {
    $categories = $app-&gt;category_names;
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Sound paranoid? One definition of a good programmer is someone who looks both
ways before crossing a one-way street. So you roll out your new code with your
feature turned <em>off</em> and after you verify everything is good, you turn on your
feature. How?</p>

<h1><a name="use-control-panels"></a>Use Control Panels</h1>

<p>Typically, a good system for feature switches should have a
web-based control panel that lists each feature and shows, amongst other things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The name of the feature</li>
<li>A description of what the feature is for</li>
<li>The current on-off state</li>
<li>Whether the feature is permanent (more on that later)</li>
<li>An “on-off” history of the feature</li>
</ul>

<p>The “on-off” history is simply an audit log. At minimum, you want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who toggled the feature</li>
<li>The date it was turned on/off</li>
<li>Why it was turned on/off</li>
<li>Possibly the release-tag of the software</li>
</ul>

<p>An audit log of the history can be immensely useful if you want to turn on a
feature that was turned off for several months and you don’t remember why.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> For companies that make heavy use of feature switches,
this can be invaluable. If your company is structured well enough, you might
even want to include what team the feature belongs to, or what departments are
responsible for it. Because so many companies are structured differently, it’s
hard to give clear guidance without knowing the specifics.</p>

<h1><a name="dont-use-control-panels"></a>Don’t Use Control Panels</h1>

<p>Yes, feature switches are usually used via control panels and they make it easy
to turn features on and off, but there are caveats. It sometimes happens that
enabling a new feature causes every page on your site to crash, taking down the
control panel! Oops. Having a control panel running on a dedicated server,
separate from the servers using the features can help to mitigate this. Having
command-line tools to turn features on or off can also be useful. <strong>Do not rely
on control panels alone</strong>. Nothing’s worse than having everything web-based and
losing web access.</p>

<h1><a name="permanent-features"></a>Permanent Features</h1>

<p>One thing often overlooked for features switches is that some of them should be
permanent. Imagine that your site goes viral and you’re hitting unprecedented
amounts of load and you’re struggling. Some sites handle this by having optional
features on the site wrapped in permanent feature switches. If your site is
struggling under a heavy load, being able to toggle off optional features such
as autocomplete or “related searches” that aren’t critical can help you manage
that load. Your site experience degrades gracefully instead of simply crashing.</p>

<h1><a name="sampled-switches"></a>“Sampled” Switches</h1>

<p>Before turning on a switch, it’s often useful to turn it on only for a subset of
requests. For example, you might only want 10% of users to experience it. If a
feature turns out to be disastrous, this can limit the impact.
However, this can be odd for someone who sees a new feature, refreshes a web
page, and that feature disappears because they are no longer in the randomly
selected subset. Making such features persistent per user can be tricky, though.
Do you rely on cookies? Your mobile app may not use cookies. Or someone might
switch browsers, such as switch from their work to their personal computer.</p>

<p>Don’t stress about this (unless you’re doing A/B testing). “Sampled” features
are short-lived. As feature switches are primarily a site reliability tool, the
limited sample run is just there to avoid disaster and you should go 100% as
soon as is feasible.</p>

<h1><a name="naming-conventions"></a>Naming Conventions</h1>

<p>For one of our clients, they have no naming convention for their features, but
they use features heavily. We wrote code to scan our <code>CODEOWNERS</code> file to dump a
list of all features in our code in order to regularly monitor them. This
allowed us to do heavy cleanup when we found many features that had been running
successfully for years, but were never cleaned. Even this was limited because
many of “our” features were scattered in other parts of the codebase.</p>

<p>To deal with this, establishing a naming convention early on can make it easier
to search for features. Are you on the advertising team and you have a new
feature offering a discount for first-time buyers? You use <code>ADV-</code> as a prefix:
<code>ADV-FIRST_TIME_BUYER</code>. Searching for all features prefixed with <code>ADV-</code> gives
you an overview of the features your team has running.</p>

<p>When you identify a naming convention, do not put ticket numbers in the feature
name. Many companies switch ticketing systems and old ticket numbers become
useless. Instead, having a “Ticket URL” field on your form when you create a
feature allows others to click through and understand the intent of that
feature.</p>

<h1><a name="operations"></a>Operations</h1>

<h2><a name="errors"></a>Errors</h2>

<p>If you dump out rich error data to error logs, include a list of running
features, sorted by last start time. Frequently, new errors show up due to
recently introduced features and this makes it much easier to debug, especially
if first time buyers sometimes can’t place orders and you see the
<code>ADV-FIRST_TIME_BUYER</code> feature was just switched on. This makes life much
easier.</p>

<h2><a name="communications"></a>Communications</h2>

<p>Let other teams know when you’re about to start a new features, especially your
site reliability engineers (or equivalent). Give them a heads-up about the
intent of the feature and what to look for if their are issues. Such
communication can allow tracking down issues faster.</p>

<h2><a name="simplicity"></a>Simplicity</h2>

<p>Feature switches are a site reliability tool. Keep them simple. You don’t want
your site to break because someone made the feature switch tool too complicated.
This is one of the reasons I prefer features to be “booleans” (in other words,
“on or off”). Some recommend feature tools that allow you to do this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">my $categories;
if ( 'enhanced' eq feature_on('SOME_FEATURE') ) {
    $categories = $app-&gt;categories_enhanced;
}
elsif ( 'expanded' eq feature_on('SOME_FEATURE') ) {
    $categories = $app-&gt;categories_expanded;
}
elsif ( feature_on('SOME_FEATURE') ) {
    warn &quot;Unknown feature category for SOME_FEATURE&quot;;
}
$categories //= $app-&gt;category_names;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Does the above start to look complicated? Well, kinda. If you allow more than
just “on” or “off”, you need to check for the case where the feature value
doesn’t match expectations. Maybe someone added a new value to the feature?
Maybe <code>expanded</code> was actually <code>expandable</code> and you misspelled it in your code.
By allowing these multiple values, you’re complicating code that’s a site
reliability tool. KISS: Keep it simple, stupid. Feature switches are there to
make life easier. Don’t overthink them.</p>

<h2><a name="clean-features-regularly"></a>Clean Features Regularly</h2>

<p>Aside from “permanent” features that you want to always be able to switch off,
it’s important to regularly clean features. Otherwise, you get into messes like
this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">if (feature_on('FEATURE_1')) {
    # do something
    if (feature_on('FEATURE_2')) {
        # do something else
    }
    elsif (feature_on('FEATURE_3') {
        # do yet another thing
        if (feature_on('FEATURE_4')) {
            ...
        }
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Not only does that make the code harder to read, you can wind up with cases
where features work well on their own, but there could be some unknown
interaction between conflicting features that won’t be noticed unless you have
the right combination of features toggled on or off. This is miserable to debug.</p>

<h1><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Feature switches are an incredibly powerful site reliability tool which can
often eliminate the need to redeploy your software if something goes wrong. This
can improve your customer experience and dramatically cut costs. However, like
any new system you implement, you want to take some time up front deciding how
it will be used and what your best practices are.</p>

<p>You will probably find that the best practices you develop for your company
differ from what I describe above. That’s OK. I’m not dogmatic. But planning for
this in advance can give you greater confidence in pushing new code that might
otherwise be cause for concern.</p>
