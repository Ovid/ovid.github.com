<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>If you have EU customers and you're uncertain how GDPR impacts you, stop
reading this and hire a lawyer. Now.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

<p>This is not legal advice. If you have EU-resident customers, hire a lawyer.
Now.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I work for <a href="https://allaroundtheworld.fr/">All Around The
World</a>, a consulting firm based in France. Not only have we been impacted
by the <a href="https://eugdpr.org/">General Data Protection Regulation</a>
(GDPR) law, our clients have as well. What we have seen is that there's often
a lack of understanding of the consequences of GDPR and companies with EU
customers face bankruptcy if they fall afoul of this legislation. The GDPR
essentially forces companies to take security, privacy, and record keeping
seriously.  GDPR fines for non-compliance are designed to be severely
punitive, up to and including driving companies into bankruptcy.</p>

<p>You do not need to suffer a data breach to be hit with these fines; if you
regularly handle data on EU customers and you're found to not be complying
with GDPR regulations, you may be sanctioned. What's worse is that <a
href="https://www.reedsmith.com/en/perspectives/2018/06/potential-conflict-and-harmony-between-gdpr-and-the-cloud-act">local
laws, such as the US CLOUD Act, are sometimes in conflict with the GDPR</a>,
meaning that you can be caught between contradictory legal requirements. You
need a lawyer.</p>

<p>The EU worked for years on the law, finally adopting it on April 14th,
2016. It become <em>enforceable</em> on May 25, 2018. Companies had two years
to get ready, so non-compliance is not tolerated. The Cambridge Analytica
scandal has made the situation even worse. <a
href="https://gizmodo.com/facebook-fined-just-645-000-in-uk-over-cambridge-analy-1829989116">Though
Facebook was fined £500,000 for misusing customer data</a>, there's anger that
this paltry amount was the maximum fine that could be levied at the time. Had
GDPR been in effect at the time, <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/07/11/facebooks-ico-fine-is-tiny-but-what-of-its-reputation/">Facebook
could have been fined up to $1.8 <em>billion</em></a>. While "good faith"
efforts to comply with the law will be taken into account, if the EU desires
to make an example of a company (and they will), a US company taking money out
of the EU will be a much more desirable target than bankrupting an EU company
keeping money in the EU. You need a lawyer.</p>

<h2>The Legal Situation</h2>

<p>There is a strict requirement that you make a "good faith" effort to
achieve GDPR compliance. Before anything else, you must realize that
GDPR-compliance is a legal issue, not a technical one. If you simply instruct
your IT staff to make it easy to report and purge personal data, you're well
on your way to bankruptcy.  This is not a good faith effort because it
demonstrates a lack of knowledge of GDPR regulations.</p>

<p>If you are found to be non-compliant, <a
href="https://eugdpr.org/the-regulation/gdpr-faqs/">there are two levels of
fines</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Up to the <em>greater</em> of 4% of global annual turnover or €20
  million for the most serious failures, such as insufficient customer
  consent.</li>
  <li>Up to the <em>greater</em> of 2% of global annual turnover or €10
  million for the other failures, such as not having a Data Protection Office
  (if required), failure to report breaches, or not conducting an impact
  assessment.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, you face bankruptcy if you get this wrong. This is serious
enough that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44248448">many
US-based Web sites are no longer available here in Europe</a>. Complying with
GDPR can be costly if your IT staff are inexperienced. Not to put too fine a
point on it: the strong worldwide demand for software developers has led many
companies to hire inexperienced developers. Even expert developers often build
poor systems when faced with significant budget or time constraints. Companies
rush build software to solve problems <em>now</em> with little thought to the
<a href="/articles/death-by-database.html">long-term
consequences of poorly-built software</a>. GDPR isn't going to improve this
situation, but it's going to severely punish companies who get this wrong.</p>

<h2>Basic GDPR Compliance</h2>

<p>In order to achieve GDPR compliance, you need to, at minimum, do the
following, keeping in mind that there are major caveats to each of these:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Request consent from your customers to track their data.</li>
  <li>Appoint a Data Protection Officer, if required.</li>
  <li>Create a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).</li>
  <li>Maintain records of all personal data processing activities.</li>
  <li>Notify EU authories of data breaches with 72 hours.</li>
  <li>Understand the "right to be forgotten."</li>
  <li>Provide customers with information on how you use their data.</li>
</ul>

<p>How these issues are applied will vary company to company. However, keep in
mind that <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/consent/">you generally do not
have the right to deny services to customers if they fail to give consent to
having their data tracked</a>. There are exceptions to consent, such as <a
href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-54/">the processing of personal data
for reasons of public interest, such as in the health sector</a>. And yes,
this also applies to your EU-resident employees, not just customers.</p>

<h3>Data Protection Officers</h3>

<p>In short: <a
href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rules-business-and-organisations/obligations/data-protection-officers/does-my-company-organisation-need-have-data-protection-officer-dpo_en">if
you handle personal information on a large scale or regularly monitor data
subjects, you need a Data Protection Officer (DPO)</a>. Keep in mind that <a
href="http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/recital-30-GDPR.htm">Recital 30 of
the GDPR</a> clarifies that IP addresses are personal information.  Examples
of companies requiring a DPO include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Any government body (except courts) or public authority</li>
  <li>E-commerce companies tracking customer purchases</li>
  <li>Hospitals and clinics</li>
  <li>Advertising firms targeting personal data</li>
  <li>Telephone or internet providers</li>
  <li>Virtually any company offering financial or insurance services</li>
  <li>Geo-location services used for statistical purposes</li>
  <li>Recruiters who store candidate information</li>
  <li>Security firms monitoring public spaces</li>
</ul>

<p>Small scale tracking of personal data, such as a individual doctors or
lawyers, generally do not need a DPO.</p>

<p>Of course, the above list is not exhaustive. If you're not sure, consult a
lawyer.</p>

<p>If you require a DPO, <a
href="https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/data-protection/reference-library/data-protection-officer-dpo_en">the
following conditions apply</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They must not have a conflict of interesting (controllers, IT directors,
  CEOs, etc.)</li>
  <li>They must have sufficient budget and personnel to perform their task</li>
  <li>They report directly to top management and must not have a
  supervisor</li>
  <li>They may be an outside consultant or firm, but they must not have a
  short or fixed-term contract</li>
  <li>Their term must be between two to five years, but may be extended up to
  ten years</li>
  <li>They must be knowledgeable in both GDPR-compliance and your internal
  systems (it's understood that the latter will take time)</li>
  <li>To protect against retaliatory dismissal, they can only be dismissed with the consent of the <a
  href="https://edps.europa.eu/node/3100#edps">European Data Protection
  Supervisor</a> (EDPS)</li>
  <li>They must have full power to investigate and correct GDPR compliance within the
  organization</li>
  <li>They must <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/node/3108#notification">notify
  the EDPS</a> of any data processing activity that is likely
  to present significant risk "to the rights and freedoms of data
  subjects".</li>
</ul>

<p>The above list, of course, is not exhaustive.</p>

<h2>IT Considerations</h2>

<p>Now, and only now, do we begin to touch on the IT considerations. The above
was merely to give you a sense of the scale of the GDPR directives. This
section is intentionally left short because it should not be viewed as a
checklist to becoming GDPR-compliant. If in doubt, consult a lawyer.</p>

<p>The <em>legal</em> implications must be addressed first. One you have a DPO
(if needed), and have drafted a comprehensive plan to protect your customer's
data, you can start work on how to implement this. Implementing GDPR
requirements without fully understanding them risks wasting money and time
developing systems that are not fit for purpose. Once you have a strong
understanding, however, you can begin to address the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Asking for consent in a clear, intelligible manner that gives consumer
  full control over how their data is managed</li>
  <li>Develop reporting to track usage of all personal data</li>
  <li>Respond to consumer requests for your usage of their personal
  information</li>
  <li>Respond to consumer requests for the "right to be forgotten"</li>
  <li>Ensure that disaster recovery and data backups do not restore
  "forgotten" information</li>
  <li>Restrict internal access to sensitive data</li>
  <li>Hire a reputable, external company to do a security audit and have
  developers fix discovered issues</li>
</ul>

<p>The security assessment is critical: all the "good faith" in the world
isn't going to protect you if you have a <a
href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/experian-breach/">Experian-style data
breach</a>. The EU wants to show that the GDPR has real teeth and you don't
want to be the example.</p>
