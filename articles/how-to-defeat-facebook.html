<h1><a name="disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer</h1>

<p>Yes, I know, this is a big post. You're probably not going to read all of
it and that's OK. I understand. However, if you know of others who feel that
Facebook needs competition, please share this with them. You can't go up
against a multi-billion dollar corporation with a tweet or a 3 paragraph blog
entry.</p>

</figure>

<p>Chris Hughes, one of the founders of Facebook, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html" target="_blank">has called for it to be dismantled</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. Needless to say this generated a ton
of media coverage for one simple reason: social networks are broken. They’re
driving us apart instead of bringing us together. You hop onto Facebook and
see old friends from school spewing vile accusations about your favorite
political party.  Your beloved uncle is sharing another stupid meme while you
sigh and search Snopes for a URL to post in response. You see close friends in
relationships publicly, bitterly, "break up" online where everyone can read
their accusations. And that's the mild stuff; the hard stuff is much, much
worse.</p>

<p>You jump from news stories about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html" target="_blank">Facebook being used to build support for genocide</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> to <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/11/6/18068048/christopher-wylie-election-day-cambridge-analytica-whistleblower-facebook" target="_blank">foreign propaganda campaigns to manipulate elections</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> to
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/03/facebook-no-one-reported-nz-shooting-video-during-17-minute-livestream/" target="_blank">livestreaming a mass murder in New Zealand</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>


<p>And it's not stopping, though Facebook is belatedly responding. They take
down the livestreams of the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2709224/two-afghan-migrants-revealed-as-those-arrested-over-horrific-three-hour-rape-streamed-on-facebook-live-in-sweden/" target="_blank">regular rapes</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, the <a href="https://medium.com/@fatimaalmahmoud/gang-rape-on-facebook-live-why-did-facebook-not-interrupt-the-broadcast-9cc72275c3aa" target="_blank">gang rapes</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/facebook-live-sexual-assault_n_58d431aae4b03787d3567e1d" target="_blank">child rapes</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3426352/facebook-live-clips-murder-suicide-shootings-report/" target="_blank">murders and suicides</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, and more. This is somewhat better than in 2016
when <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2016/06/17/technology/facebook-live-shooting-death/index.html" target="_blank">Facebook refused to remove the livestream of a murder because "it
doesn&rsquo;t violate the company&rsquo;s community standards"</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. </p>

<p>And before we go any further, just ask yourself one question: how can a
company get so wrong that they think livestreaming murders isn't violating
"community standards"?</p>

<h2><a name="the-opportunity"></a>The Opportunity</h2>

<p>Let's see if we can figure this out. Facebook has <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/" target="_blank">2.3 billion monthly active users</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, millions of whom want anything else,
and <a href="https://medium.com/utopiapress/facebook-lost-15-million-users-in-the-united-states-since-2017-705155060c4f" target="_blank">15 million of their most valuable customers have walked away since 2017</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. Despite this, Facebook still basked in <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/223289/facebooks-quarterly-net-income/" target="_blank">almost seven billion dollars in net income for the final quarter of 2018</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
You would think that investors would be drooling at this. Millions of Facebook
high-value customers are <em>begging</em> for a new market! Even more
interesingly, there's little barrier to entry into this market.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span>
Taking a percentage of Facebook's market share is a huge business opportunity
but investors don&rsquo;t seem to be biting. Why is that? And can it be
changed?</p>

<figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/social-networks.jpg" width="600" alt="An image of a mobile phone showing many social network icons">
    <figcaption>Guess which one is the 800-pound gorilla? <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/apps-blur-button-close-up-267350/" target-"_blank">Source</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Well, as it turns out, investors were biting but they were also bitten.
With seeing so many other social networks getting up, swinging, and missing,
it's no wonder that investors today are wary. However, once you start diving
into mess, you find that many otherwise savvy investors have fallen for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania" target="_blank">tulip mania</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and
haven't paid attention to the real issues customers care about. Thus, the
contenders fail.</p>

<h2><a name="the-background"></a>The Background</h2>

<p>Many of these would-be competitors have tried to take on Facebook, with the
recent Google Plus shutdown being one of the more dramatic failures. Given the
long history, we need a lot of backstory to unpack what's going on here.</p>

<p>First, let's distinguish between a General Purpose Social Network, GPSN,
and a Special Purpose Social Network, SPSN, (though there's a lot of grey area
here). Many of <a href="https://medium.com/utopiapress/facebook-lost-15-million-users-in-the-united-states-since-2017-705155060c4f" target="_blank">the millions leaving Facebook for Instagram</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, are leaving a GPSN for a
SPSN. Instagram is for sharing photos and videos.  If you have no photos or
videos to share, you may not find an Instagram account as appealing, though
you may have one to follow others.  <span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-2"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> Twitter is closer to a GPSN, but it's still rather
limited in its features (that, in itself, is a feature).  Facebook, like
Myspace, or the now-defunct Google Plus, is a GPSN. It has a wide variety of
features that appeal to many people. Want to connect but don't want to share
photos? Facebook. Want to connect and don't want to be limited to 280
characters? Facebook. Want to connect and regularly organize or participate in
local events? Facebook. Want to have a richer reading experience about what
your friends are doing? Facebook. Facebook has it all.</p>

<p>GPSNs are more geared towards general-purpose social networking without
trying to shoehorn you into a particular mode of sharing. While many people
enjoy a variety of social networks, <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/social-media-engagement/" target="_blank">Facebook
dominates in in terms of daily user engagement</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, with half of its users
logging on more than once a day.</p>

<p>The distinction between GPSN and SPSN is important because this article is
only focusing on the former. The latter gets lots of traction in narrower
markets and has a robust, lively community of competitors. GPSNs, however,
have been reduced to "Facebook or nothing" as of this writing.</p>

<h1><a name="the-problem"></a>The Problem</h1>

<p>Before we can really get down to the business case for a Facebook
competitor, we need to understand why so many people are clamoring to leave
Facebook. Once we do that, we can understand why so many David&rsquo;s have
falled before this Goliath. And once we <em>do</em> understand what is wrong
with Facebook, the failures become almost obvious (given 20-20 hindsight).</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s be crystal-clear about what Facebook has done right:
they&rsquo;ve created a generic product that has <em>everyone with an internet
connection as their target market</em>. If you can connect to the net and you
want to be social, Facebook is perfect for you.  Of course, if you say
"everyone is my target market" to an investor, that&rsquo;s a quick way to get
them to leave, but given Facebook&rsquo;s 2 billion+ user accounts, we really
do have a serious "everyone" claim here.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-3"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/smiling-for-camera.jpg" width="600" alt="An image of three women smiling for a smartphone picture being taken by the man next to them.">
    <figcaption>We are social by nature. <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/three-smiling-women-beside-man-holding-smartphone-1547468/" target-"_blank">Source</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Second, given that so many people on the net want to be social, the second
major thing that Facebook has done right is not being absolutely awful at what
they do. That sounds ridiculous, but when you look at the clown car of
wanna-be competitors, it&rsquo;s amazing how many of them actually got
traction and then fell down because they weren&rsquo;t up to the job,
technically.</p>

<p>Third, given the fact that the core Facebook product started out rather
limited, they&rsquo;ve been smart enough to <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs" target="_blank">offer APIs to allow others
to build value for Facebook</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, something that allows them to offer much
more to the public without having to build it themselves. Just look at all of
those annoying game requests you get to begin to understand whats' happening
here. Surprisingly, many competitors have ignored this.</p>

<p>So what has Facebook done wrong? Just about everything else.</p>

<p>After being relentlessly pummeled by Facebook-related horror stories, I
finally said "enough" and started really digging in to understand what is
wrong with Facebook. I've found three major problem areas that need to be
solved, but they generally have the root cause of being a secretive,
unaccountable company focused primarily on profits and market domination. As a
businesperson, I will humbly suggest that there is <em>nothing</em> wrong with
that. Honestly, you want to make money and destroy your competition? That's
perfectly fine.</p>

<p>Where I draw the line is <em>ethics</em>. Facebook has such a huge impact
on the public sector that excluding itself from accountability and acting in
complete secrecy has allowed it to become a monster. Ironically, Facebook has
been so horrifying, and there have been so few interesting competitors, that
people are suffering "compassion fatigue" and when Facebook does something
awful, they just ignore it or share it on Facebook. Things that would kill any
other company are shrugged off for Facebook.</p>

<p>So I dug in, hard, trying to get to the bottom of this. I've read so many
articles about Facebook and their atrocities that I fear I'm becoming numb to
them, but that means I can give you a summary and spare you the worst.</p>

<h2><a name="trust"></a>Trust</h2>

<p>This entire section could simply be about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/17/the-cambridge-analytica-scandal-changed-the-world-but-it-didnt-change-facebook" target="_blank">the Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. Facebook essentially allowed Cambridge
Analytica to mine Facebook's data to manipulate the US public opinion in the
2016 presidential election, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/11/bbc-downplaying-facebook-brexit-scandal-bias" target="_blank">British public opinion on the Brexit vote</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.  Or there were <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-says-fake-accounts-linked-to-russia-bought-ads-during-us-election-2017-9?IR=T" target="_blank">the Facebook ads purchased by the Russian government to influence the US
election.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, even though <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2017/07/20/politics/facebook-russia-investigation-senate-intelligence-committee/index.html" target="_blank">Facebook originally said there was no evidence for this and stonewalled US
Congressional investigations</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>Or maybe you don't like Facebook, so you don't have an account. Don't
worry, <a href="https://theconversation.com/shadow-profiles-facebook-knows-about-you-even-if-youre-not-on-facebook-94804" target="_blank">thanks to "shadow profiles", Facebook still probably knows who you
are</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and there's nothing you can do about it.</p>

<p>Or consider the time when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/31/apple-facebook-campus-permissions-revoked-teens-access-data-iphone-app" target="_blank">Apple had to revoke a Facebook app's permission because Facebook cheated and
signed the app with a certificate they weren't allowed to use.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. There's
no excuse for this, but they cheated for the sole purpose of collecting more
data about people, including people as young as 13.</p>

<p>And why not consider the incredibly poor security mistakes made when
"protecting" your data? For example, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-passwords-plaintext-change-yours/" target="_blank">Facebook stored millions of passwords in plain text</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, one of the most
basic of security blunders. Or how about discovering that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/04/03/millions-facebook-user-records-exposed-data-breach/" target="_blank">half a billion user records were publicly available after they were uploaded
to Amazon Web Services</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. Facebook could put an end to that by not letting
this information be collected by third-party applications, but that's not
going to happen.</p>

<p>As for privacy, as long as Facebook maintains their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_real-name_policy_controversy" target="_blank">real-name policy</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, you will never have strong privacy guarantees. Facebook
has tried to mitigate some of the issues with this policy, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/changes-facebooks-real-names-policy-still-dont-fix-problem" target="_blank">but their "fix" raised more problems than the policy itself</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. Facebook is
unlikely to address this issue because <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/02/facebook-share-price-slumps-20-dollars" target="_blank">fake names cause the share price to drop</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>The privacy issue hits Facebook again and again and again. For many people,
it's their number one reason for wanting to find another GPSN. Zuckerberg has
flipped from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2010/jan/11/facebook-privacy" target="_blank">privacy is no longer a "social norm"</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, to insisting Facebook would become

he's more likely to be known as "the boy who cried privacy."</p>

<p>Of course, given all of the scandals, why doesn't the board simply fire
Zuckerberg as CEO and move in a new direction? Because they can't. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/05/why-mark-zuckerberg-wont-step-down-as-facebook-chairman.html" target="_blank">Mark Zuckerberg has a majority stake in Facebook and can fire any director,
at any time, without cause.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. The board can't lift a finger against
Zuckerberg and he knows it. He has complete control over everything Facebook
does.</p>

<h2><a name="horror"></a>Horror</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html" target="_blank">The Myanmar military used Facebook posts to gain support for the genocide
against Muslims in Myanmar</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. White nationalists have long used Facebook
to coordinate activities, but <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-bans-white-nationalism-after-pressure-civil-rights-groups-n987991" target="_blank">only recently has Facebook started banning those groups</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47805113" target="_blank">And a Kenyan
vigilante group is using Facebook to murder people suspected of being in
gangs</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.  These and many other scandals would be enough to destroy many
companies, but "scandal fatigue" has definitely set in. However, this isn't
where the worst of it is.</p>

<p>Facebook's livestreaming is mostly boring, innocuous, and sometimes
touching. And every once in a while its mind-numbing horror will turn your
stomach. <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3426352/facebook-live-clips-murder-suicide-shootings-report/" target="_blank">It's incredibly painful to read about.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> It includes suicides, parents
murdering their children, parents abusing their children, gang rapes, and
more.  <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/03/facebook-no-one-reported-nz-shooting-video-during-17-minute-livestream/" target="_blank">And do not forget the New Zealand mass murder that was livetsreamed.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
Facebook (read: Zuckerberg) knows this. Despite repeatedly livestreaming
horrific crimes, Facebook knows they are making a lot of money and <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/mark-zuckerberg-defends-facebook-livestreaming-after-new-zealand-massacre/" target="_blank">Zuckerberg refuses to do anything about it.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></p>

<p>They've been repeatedly asked to add a time-delay to livestreams, or remove
them entirely until they can figure out how to stop this.  However, they're
serious about not delaying livestreams, even if there are brutal crimes
involved, but they're taking a huge amount of heat over this. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/facebook-live-streaming-abuse-one-strike-policy/" target="_blank">Their response?</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></p>

<blockquote>“From now on, anyone who violates our most serious policies will
be restricted from using Live for set periods of time — for example 30 days —
starting on their first offense. For instance, someone who shares a link to a
statement from a terrorist group with no context will now be immediately
blocked from using Live for a set period of time,” Facebook VP of integrity
Guy Rosen wrote.</blockquote>

<p>Read that again. This is the "Vice President of Integrity" explaining that
Facebook won't delay the livestreaming of rapes and murders.</p>

<h2><a name="broadcasting"></a>Broadcasting</h2>

<p>This issue seems relatively minor from a "news" point of view, but it
turns out that it's one of Facebook's biggest problems. From a source inside
Facebook who cannot be named: "the number one reason people leave Facebook is
because their mom joins." <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/dec/27/facebook-dead-and-buried-to-teens-research-finds?CMP=fb_us" target="_blank">An independent study confirmed this.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> There are several things going on,
much of what deals with the difference between online and offline social
interactions. Offline, social interactions are face-to-face. We know who we're
dealing with and can adjust ourselves accordingly. Online, you're in what I
call "broadcast" mode. You don't necessarily know who you're communicating
with and nobody wants to tell a dirty joke to their grandmother.</p>

<figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/broadcasting.jpg" width="600" alt="An image of a microphone on a laptop">
    <figcaption>Social media broadcasts whether you like it or not. <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/microphone-on-laptop-1212829/" target-"_blank">Source</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Google+ attempted to address the "broadcasting" issue by creating "circles"
that you could put people into. If you posted, you could say "just share with
these circles" and Grandma would never see that naughty joke you shared.  But
it was a chore trying to always remember which content you could share with
which circles.  People join social networks to be social, not to remember
which switches they need to flip every time they want to be social.</p>

<p>And the Google+ circles, while trying to fix what you were broadcasting,
did nothing to address what you were receiving. The broadcasting problem works
both ways.</p>

<h2><a name="the-unholy-trifecta-trust-horror-and-broadcasting"></a>The Unholy Trifecta: Trust, Horror, and Broadcasting</h2>

<p>So why do I focus on these three problems of Facebook? From my reading,
they're the three central problems that Facebook cannot overcome (in this
analysis, privacy falls under "trust").</p>

<p><strong>If you're going to take on Facebook, you have to address all
three of these areas.</strong></p>

<p>This is one of the premier reasons why the various competitors have failed.
The software landscape is littered with failed replacements for Microsoft Word
because the programmers correctly realized that people only uses a handful or
Word's features, but they failed ot notice that everyone uses a
<em>different</em> handful.</p>

<p>I've talked to many people about Facebook, read many articles, and have
seen that it's the same problem as replacing Microsoft Word. Many people don't
care about the broadcasting issue, or the privacy issues, or livestreaming
issues, and so on. Trying to fix just one issue ignores large swaths of people
who don't care about your issue. In fact, most competitors seem fixated on the
privacy issue when it's the <em>broadcasting</em> issue most people care
about!</p>

<p>With that in mind, let's look at our contenders.</p>

<h1><a name="the-contenders"></a>The Contenders</h1>

<p>What follows is not an exhaustive list of contenders, but it's
representative of the major contenders and their failures. The key takeaway
here is that some contenders definitely could have taken on Facebook, but
failed in almost comical ways.</p>

<h2><a name="friendster"></a>Friendster</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster" target="_blank">Friendster wasn't
the first social network, but it's probably the best-known early contender.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> They launched in 2002 and quickly racked up millions of followers, several
competitors, and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/15/business/yourmoney/15friend.html" target="_blank">$30 million buyout offer from Google.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> The founder, Jonathan Abrams,
turned down that offer and Friendster later failed, slain by MySpace. There
were many reasons for this failure, but a critical issue was simply poor
performance. As it grew in popularity, its home page could take almost a
minute to load.</p> 

<h2><a name="myspace"></a>MySpace</h2>

<p>MySpace, once the most popular Web site in the US, <a href="https://deadline.com/2011/06/myspace-debacle-vindication-for-fired-viacom-ceo-tom-freston-144587/" target="_blank">spectacularly imploded after Rupert Murdoch purchased them for $580
million.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. A large part of this seems to be that Murdoch's NewsCorp just
didn't "get" the internet. You move fast and you react to what your users
want; post-buyout, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150208035248/http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/magazine/content/11_27/b4235053917570.htm#p3" target="_blank">MySpace moved slowly and built a bunch of buggy, half-thought out features.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> Seriously, who spends valuable developer time and money building a virtual
karaoke machine? Meanwhile, Facebook was opening up their API so that
third-party companies could build the features <em>for</em> Facebook, allowing
Facebook to focus on their core products. So again, we see the death of a
social network due, in part, to technical limitations which should never have
happened.</p>

<h2><a name="orkut"></a>Orkut</h2>

<figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/orkut.jpg" width="600" alt="A screenshot of the defunct Orkut Social Network">
    <figcaption>Orkut in all its glory! <a
    href="https://www.vox.com/2014/6/30/11628448/flashing-back-to-2004-as-orkut-fades-away-a-decade-later" target-"_blank">Source</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Orkut could have become something. It was launched to much fanfare, <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/01/23/google_debuts_friendsterclone_orkut/" target="_blank">including this bit from The Register</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>Undetered by the feeding frenzy around the social networking
bubble, and rebuffed by Friendster Inc, which it attempted to buy, Google has
decided to build one better. Given Friendster's well-documented problems with
coping with a large number of users, and <strong>Google's world class
expertise in scalability</strong>, it ought to be more than up to the
technical challenge.</blockquote>

<p>Except ... <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/09/29/marissa-mayer-orkut/" target="_blank">here's
what Marissa Mayer, then with Google, had to say about Orkut</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<blockquote>Orkut launched in January of 2004, and as Mayer remembers it, it
attracted “several million users in a few days“. This caused the network to
slow down to a crawl, Mayer noted. And that, in turn, turned a lot of users
away from it — at least in the U.S. “It’s all about speed here,” she
said.</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/6/30/11628448/flashing-back-to-2004-as-orkut-fades-away-a-decade-later" target="_blank">Vox has an interesting article about the mess that was Orkut</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, but it
basically amounts to a part-time project, written by Google employee Orkut
Büyükkökten, getting co-opted as a Google product, even though it was never
designed to scale.  What's worse, because it was largely built with Microsoft
products, Google engineers deemed it "not scalable" and by the time they
finally got around to fixing it, Facebook had been launched and the damage had
been done. So again, we see the death of a social network due, in part, to
technical limitations which should never have happened.</p>

<h2><a name="hi5"></a>hi5</h2>

<p>Not much to say about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi5" target="_blank">hi5</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. Launched in 2004, for a few years they were the second or third most
popular social network in the US. <a href="http://www.speeli.com/articles/view/why-did-hi5-fail" target="_blank">speeli.com
has an interesting summary of why hi5 went nowhere.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> Amongst other things,
you could see who viewed your profile and thus had the incredibly creepy
experience of knowing who your cyber-stalkers were. However, their failure was
probably due to the fierce competition with MySpace and Facebook, combined
with poor earnings and a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2009/03/31/after-a-funding-failure-hi5-kind-of-died-today/" target="_blank">funding collapse</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. By 2009, <a href="https://everything-pr.com/hi5-social-media/" target="_blank">hi5 was focusing
heavily on virtual goods for monetization and while Facebook focused on user
acquisition around the globe.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> Facebook, of course, had heavy VC funding,
and the hi5 social network never quite seemed as polished. Perhaps if hi5's
last funding round hadn't collapsed, things would be different today.</p>

<h2><a name="google-buzz"></a>Google Buzz</h2>

<p>(Note: we're ignoring "Google Wave" because, despite people talking about
it as being the predecessor to Buzz, it was a collaboration tool and not a
social network)</p>

<p>Included only for completeness: Google has a habit of launching various
social media products, seeing little user engagement, and then dropping them
again. In the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Buzz" target="_blank">Google Buzz</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, many
users didn't understand what it was for, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/189081/google_buzz_criticized_for_disclosing_gmail_contacts.html" target="_blank">it publicly displayed who you most chatted and emailed with</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, and <a href="http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20101113200852/http://www.hlrecord.org/news/harvard-law-student-brings-class-action-lawsuit-over-google-buzz-1.1165204" target="_blank">the class action lawsuit probably did little to help.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. It lasted only two
years before Google put it out of its misery.</p>

<h2><a name="yahoo-360deg"></a>Yahoo! 360&deg;</h2>

<p>Remember them? Me neither. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2007/10/23/yang-decides-to-shut-down-yahoo-360%E2%80%94nobody-notices/" target="_blank">Nobody really had any idea what it was for, but it was "social"</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<h2><a name="bebo"></a>Bebo</h2>

<p>Bebo really could have been something. At their height they had over 40
million users with strong engagement and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7294174.stm" target="_blank">sold themselves
to AOL for a shocking $850 million!</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> AOL, rather than having a sound vision
of where they were going, was trying to use the piles of money they were
sitting on to buy something popular and stay relevant. Two years later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/technology/18aol.html" target="_blank">AOL
sold Bebo for $10 million.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>AOL, somehow, someway, got this bizarro idea that they would pay almost one
billion dollars for a small social network and squeeze and squeeze and squeeze
money out of the users. But that was never to be. They had a host of internal
issues and reportedly never invested heavily in Bebo after the purchase. Bebo
had great user engagement and a 3rd-party integration API that worked well;
they actually had a chance, but there was no way AOL was going to earn back
that money.</p>

<h2><a name="google"></a>Google+</h2>

<p>Google Wave lasted two years before Google killed it. Google Buzz lasted
two years before Google killed it. Orkut hung on for about a decade before
Google killed it.</p>

<figure class="captioned">
    <img class="scaled" src="/static/images/coyote.gif" alt="Gif of Wile. E.  Coyote launching a boulder onto his own head.">
    <figcaption>Google+ Launch</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And then there was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B" target="_blank">Google+</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, arriving at
a time when many people were already getting sick of Facebook and hoping for a
decent alternative. And then it launched.</p>

<p>It's hard to be sure exactly what Google was thinking, <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/features/story/former-google-designer-explains-why-google-s-social-media-play-failed-1370662-2018-10-18" target="_blank">but one designer on the project described an epic tale of fear, politics,
and siloed development.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. Vision? The entire thing was driven by fear of
Facebook instead of "what value can we bring to our customers?"</p>

<p>And then there's <a href="https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611" target="_blank">Steve Yegge's infamous Google rant</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. He meant it to be private, but didn't
understand how to use Google+, so it was posted to the world by accident and
lovingly copied, again and again, so that it wouldn't be lost if he was
ordered to take it down. It can be summed up with one delightful
paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>Google+ is a prime example of our complete failure to understand
platforms from the very highest levels of executive leadership (hi Larry,
Sergey, Eric, Vic, howdy howdy) down to the very lowest leaf workers (hey yo).
We all don't get it. The Golden Rule of platforms is that you Eat Your Own
Dogfood. The Google+ platform is a pathetic afterthought. We had no API at all
at launch, and last I checked, we had one measly API call. One of the team
members marched in and told me about it when they launched, and I asked: "So
is it the Stalker API?" She got all glum and said "Yeah." I mean, I was
joking, but no... the only API call we offer is to get someone's stream. So I
guess the joke was on me.</blockquote>

<p>Building a social network without an API is shooting yourself in the face.
This lesson has been learned again and again and again. But not by Google.</p>

<p>Google+ introduced "Circles", allowed you to edit your posts (this
competition finally pushed Facebook to add this oft-requested feature),
Hangouts, online photo editing, and a few other nifty features, but the lack
of an API and a generally "clunky" feel meant that Google+ was off to a bad
start, despite picking up millions of users.</p>

<p>And then Google said "hey, let's piss off Youtube fans!" <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131123061437/http://www.newsday.com/business/technology/silicon-island-1.1521604/youtube-comments-require-google-account-google-faces-uproar-1.6429420" target="_blank">and required a Google+ account to comment on Youtube videos</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. And yes,
people were furious. Not only were they forced to have a Google+ account to
use Google services, but the "real name" policy meant that many people,
including those who have a genuine need to hide their identity, were locked
out. <a href="https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/210941-google-kills-mandatory-google-plus-identity-policy-rolls-back-youtube-changes" target="_blank">Google finally gave up on these changes a couple of years later</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. I can't
help but wonder who at Google thought that force feeding a social network to
their customers was really the fastest way to their hearts.</p>

<p>That being said, there <em>were</em> some nifty innovations led by Google+,
but at the end of the day, without a clear vision, Google+ slowly faded away
until Google put yet another product out of its misery.</p>

<h1><a name="honorable-mentions"></a>Honorable Mentions</h1>

<p>In the history of social networking, there are still a few other sites
worth mentioning.</p>

<p>One of the most famous is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/nyregion/12about.html" target="_blank">Diaspora</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, still in existence as <a href="https://diasporafoundation.org/" target="_blank">the Diaspora Foundation</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
They tried to raise $10,000 to compete against Facebook but <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mbs348/diaspora-the-personally-controlled-do-it-all-distr" target="_blank">quickly raised over $200,000 dollars</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, despite not having written a single
line of code. They were known as a "Facebook killer" long before entering that
search term in Google turned up murderers. Sadly, <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/16/diaspora_pre_alpha_landmines/" target="_blank">their initial release was riddled with security flaws</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, helping to stall
momentum. Another serious issue is that, because it's decentralized, <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/08/22/isis_terrorists_iaspora_social_network/" target="_blank">ISIS terrorists have started using it because it's almost impossible to
censor them there.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> Diaspora is asking users to inform on other users who
might be terrorists in an attempt to get larger "pods" to take down suspicious
accounts.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, end users didn't really find a "decentralized social
network" interesting, or they simply didn't understand it. Diaspora was
doomed.</p>

<p>Another interesting idea was <a href="https://www.minds.com/" target="_blank">minds.com</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, the <a href="https://libertarianvindicator.com/2018/05/18/exclusive-interview-with-minds-com-ceo-bill-ottman/" target="_blank">Libertarian-leaning</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, crypto-currency backed social
network.</p>

<p>Yes, you read that right. Someone thought that a crypto-currency based
social network was just what the world needed.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-4"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span>
Unsurprisingly, their traffic, never high to begin with, collapsed in the 2018
cryptocurrency crash. Any money you earned through them became instantly
worthless. However, <a href="https://github.com/Minds" target="_blank">they are open
source</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and should get kudos for that, but it's not enough to save
them.</p>

<p>If there is one social network I wanted to like, it was <a href="https://mewe.com/" target="_blank">MeWe</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, a "censorship-free" social network
with none other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee" target="_blank">Tim
Berners-Lee</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, the inventor of the Web, as an advisor. But guess what
happens to sites like Gab, Voat, and MeWe, when they claim they won't censor?
They attract those being censored. I'm sure Berners-Lee isn't very happy with
headlines like <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sir-tim-berners-lee-s-app-mewe-is-used-by-neo-nazis-and-perverts-svflhn32s" target="_blank">Sir Tim Berners-Lee’s app MeWe is used by neo-Nazis and perverts</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<blockquote> Sir Tim Berners-Lee's app MeWe included neo-Nazi posts, upskirt
“creep ... content, including posts from paedophiles and terrorist
supporters.</blockquote>

<p>I went and checked out MeWe myself and found myself in a cesspool of
white-nationalists, "WeTheSheeple", MAGA-enthusiasts, "Exposing Satanic World
Government" members, and some, I assume, are good people. It's definitely
leaning "alt-right" and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/plexodus/comments/a1jqsy/mewe_a_trip_report/" target="_blank">this Reddit posts summarizes it very well.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></p>

<h1><a name="creating-a-new-social-network"></a>Creating A New Social Network</h1>

<p><em>Note: If you have just skipped ahead to this section, this discussion
won't make as much sense.</em></p>

<p>Chris Hughes, in the aforementioned article stating that Facebook
must be dismantled, referred to undoing their acquisition of Instagram and
Whatsapp. But those are social networks with very specific niches, the SPSNs
mentioned earlier. There are still plenty of SPSNs out there. Instead, Facebook
killed the GPSNs and, as Hughes stated, gave Zuckerberg a unilateral "ability
to monitor, organize and even censor the conversations of two billion
people."</p>

<h2><a name="excellence"></a>Excellence</h2>

<p>What's needed isn't to destroy Facebook; that would risk exchanging the
devil we know for the devil we don't. Instead, what we need is competition.
The various attempts at competition I mentioned earlier failed for various
reasons.  The reasons that <em>never</em> should have occured are the cases of
technical incompetence. Friendster, MySpace (after the NewsCorp acquisition),
Orkut (the disastrous launch), Diaspora, and others not mentioned. However,
I've been in this industry for far too long for me to suspect that management
are going to get better at strategic planning,<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-5"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> or that
software "architects" will learn to go by evidence instead of their gut, or
software developers will suddenly learn how to write clean, extensible
code.</p>

<p>If a major attempt is made to take on Facebook, the attack must be
well-thought out and there must be no shortcuts on the path to technical
excellence. The investors needs to understand that building value is more
important than saving money&mdash;none of this idiotic <a href="/articles/the-tyranny-of-budgets.html">"we can save money by
hiring developers for $100 a day!"</a> You don't enter a mature,
multi-billion dollar market by winging it.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-6"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<h2><a name="trust-horror-and-broadcasting"></a>Trust, Horror, and Broadcasting</h2>

<p>As mentioned earlier, <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2001/03/23/strategy-letter-iv-bloatware-and-the-8020-myth/" target="_blank">many companies have failed to replace Microsoft word because they offered a
limited subset of features</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, ignoring that different users offer different
subsets. Many of the would-be competitors did a good job of addressing
<em>some</em> of the core issues of trust, horror, and broadcasting, but no
one has attempted to address all of them. If you want a GPSN to compete with
Facebook, addressing all of these issues up front is going to make life
easier, but how do we do that?</p>

<p>Some (Diaspora and minds.com) have attempted to address the trust issue by
being open source, but have failed in other ways, such as terribly security
issues (Diaspora) or having this weird "cryptocurrency social network" thing
that simply wasn't appealing to most (minds.com). Others have attempted to
address trust by saying "no censorship" (too many to list!), and wind up being
cesspits for racists, conspiracy theorists, and pedophiles.</p>

<figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/voat.png" width="600" alt="A horrifying screenshot of the racism on sites that veto censorship">

<p>While I believe strongly in freedom of speech, not every platform needs to
allow it. But what speech to censor? By law, <em>some</em> speech must be
censored (for example, child pornography), and that censorship varies from
country to country. And <em>that</em> raises the question of whether or not
the new company should give in to demands from authoritarian countries.</p>

<h2><a name="the-david-to-facebooks-goliath"></a>The David to Facebook's Goliath</h2>

<p>For the sake of having a name, let's call our theoretical company "<a href="https://zu.oxforddictionaries.com/translate/isizulu-english/ubuhle" target="_blank">Ubuhle</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>", the Zulu word for "beauty" or "goodness".<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-7"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<p>Many companies, including powerhouses like Google, have tried and failed to
take on Facebook. What we need is something radically different, addressing
<em>all</em> of the issues above. However, unlike Facebook's relentless drive
for profits and dominance, Ubuhle would be focused on the needs of its users.
If a social network can be thought of as a public service, the company should
act in the interests of the public, not shareholders, or Zuckerberg. Part of
that difference would be creating Ubuhle as a B Corporation. <a href="https://bcorporation.net/" target="_blank">B Corporations are different.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></p>

<blockquote>Certified B Corporations are a new kind of business that balances
purpose and profit. They are legally required to consider the impact of their
decisions on their workers, customers, suppliers, community, and the
environment. This is a community of leaders, driving a global movement of
people using business as a force for good.</blockquote>

<p>B Corporations include Ben & Jerry's, Amalgamated Bank, Kickstarter, and
thousands more. You can make a profit and guard your soul at the same
time.</p>

<p>Next, let's address the trifecta.</p>

<h3><a name="building-trust"></a>Building Trust</h3>

<h4><a name="open-source"></a>Open Source</h4>

<p>Let's just get this out of the way right now: Ubuhle's software should be
open source. <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/hub/open-source-companies#section-overview" target="_blank">There are many successful open source companies</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and Ubuhle's strength
would be the service and trust it provides, not just the code. When the code is
open source, people can look to see if we're building shadow profiles, or
inappropriately mining data, or using lax security practices.</p>

<h4><a name="open-business"></a>Open Business</h4>

<p>Next: open business. Facebook has taken in a lot of money from questionable
sources, such as Cambridge Analytica and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/russian-facebook-ads-house-intelligence-full-list/" target="_blank">Russia advertising propaganda campaigns</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> targeting US voters. Ubuhle
should have a page where users can search for all income sources, along with
their details. Instead of shrouding everything in secrecy, let it be out in
the open. The default position of Ubuhle is that people have a right to know
this information.</p>

<h4><a name="no-real-names-policy"></a>No "real names" Policy</h4>

<p>Next: use any name you want. While Ubuhle would certainly like to see real
names because it's easier for people to connect, in reality, many people have
excellent reasons to not use their real names. Imagine if someone is being
stalked by an ex and doesn't want to be found. Imagine if someone from Iran is
gay and doesn't want to be executed. Imagine if someone just doesn't think
other people need to know their real name. Imagine tons of celebrities who,
technically, can't use Facebook because their stage name doesn't match their
real name. Heck, I'm better known as <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=curtis+poe+ovid&oq=curtis+poe+ovid" target="_blank">"Ovid"</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> in much of the software world, but I
can't use that on Facebook. And trying to enforce a "real name" policy is
simply fraught with error. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_real-name_policy_controversy#Ethnic_groups" target="_blank">Facebook has banned many people for actually using their real names</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<h4><a name="community-engagement"></a>Community Engagement</h4>

<p>When Ubuhle makes major business decisions, the decisions,
and the reasons for them, should be shared with the public immediately.
Comments should be allowed and Ubuhle should directly engage with its
customers. There should be no shadowy cabal of management making secret
decisions controlling the communications of people.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-8"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<h3><a name="eliminating-horror"></a>Eliminating Horror</h3>

<p>This one is easy: no livestreaming unless we can figure out a way to make
it safe. But we can go beyond that. Community engagement would be necessary to
find an appropriate way to decide what content is acceptable. Certainly we
don't need to show the exploitation of children. And while expressing support
for neo-Nazis may be legal in most countries, Ubuhle doesn't have a
requirement to host that content. But only by working <em>with</em> the
community can we navigate what are, to be honest, very difficult waters. Free
speech advocates may be horrified by suppressing holocaust denial posts, while
others may be horrified if Ubuhle allows non-pornographic nudity. You can't
win, but you can compromise.</p>

<p>Horror means different things to different people: livestreaming rapes and
murders qualify, but so does promoting terrorism, racism, and other forms of
hate speech. How would Ubuhle handle that? How would Ubuhle support free
speech but provide a "safe" environment?</p>

<p>The answer, curiously, may lie in fixing the "broadcasting" problem.</p>

<h3><a name="controlled-broadcasting"></a>Controlled Broadcasting</h3>

<p>Nobody wants to tell their grandma a dirty joke. That's why Google+ created
circles: you controlled what you shared and with whom. But always having to
remember select the circles for posts kind of kills the whole "I just want to
share" aspect of being social. Sure, when I'm sitting in front of grandma, I
watch my tongue. But if I'm out with friends, I don't. On Facebook, you don't
know if grandma is listening to what you're telling your friends and many
people leave Facebook as a result.</p>

<p>We can fix this with content tagging and <em>you</em> decide the
filtering.</p>

<p>A default Ubuhle filter that all new users might get is "no nudity", "no
violence", and "no heavily downvoted posts." Maybe you decide to go one
further and remove politics and religion. Maybe someone else wants the
politics and not the religion. Someone else might create a custom filter to
skip all posts containing "Game of Thrones" and "GoT", hoping to avoid
spoilers.</p>

<p>With this approach, you control what you see, not Ubuhle. While certain
content would still need to be banned (child-pornography), you choose your
experience. This filter could be applied to <em>all</em> content. With the
default Ubuhle filter, assuming white-supremacist groups are heavily
downvoted,<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-9"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> you'd never see them when scrolling
through groups.</p>

<p>That's what you read, but what about what you write?</p>

<p>Imagine that I've set up three groups:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Family</li>
  <li>School friends</li>
  <li>Close friends</li>
</ol>

<p>My school friends are mostly from Texas and while they're a bunch of great
people, it's fair to say that we find each other's political views polarizing.
I could create a custom filter just for that group, which excludes anything
political I may write. Trust me, they would appreciate that.</p>

<p>What if someone's in more than one group? The most restrictive filters
would apply, unless you explicitly tag someone.</p>

<p>But how do we actually tag the content? There are a number of ways to do
this, but one way might be ...</p>

<h3><a name="ai-categorization-pipeline"></a>AI Categorization Pipeline</h3>

<p>For a first pass, there are quite a few open source AI solutions which can
categorize text, image, and video content. New content would shoot through a
pipeline of categorizers which would tag content, but not filter it (aside
from anything illegal). Would it be perfect? No, you'd still get the
occassional unwanted content. Would it be better than blasting you with any
and all content that you may not want? Absolutely. And unlike <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona" target="_blank">Facebook's human moderators</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, the AI-Pipeline would suffer no PTSD, would
not need frequent breaks from work, would not need to go home to sleep, and
would be very unlikely to consider a class action lawsuit against its
employer.</p>

<p>As an added bonus, a quick <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem" target="_blank">Fermi estimate</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
suggests that one powerful box running non-stop could replace 100 human
moderators. Even being off by an order of magnitude, that's a nice financial
savings.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-10"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<h2><a name="profit"></a>Profit?</h2>

<p>So how do you make money off of this? Many of the competitors appear to
have avoided ads. I think that was a huge mistake. People aren't idiots and
they know that a social network needs to make money. Advertising has been around
since before recorded history, <a href="https://www.tintup.com/blog/history-evolution-advertising-marketing/" target="_blank">the first TV ads appeared in 1941</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_ratings" target="_blank">Nielsen has been
doing targeted advertising since the 1930s</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. However, in the internet era,
that targeted advertising is becoming invasive, with ads following us from
site to site, to our phones back to our desktops.</p>

<p>And it gets worse. Though I doubt this was intentional on Facebook's part, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/28/facebook-ads-housing-discrimination-charges-us-government-hud" target="_blank">they've been charged with violating the Fair Housing Act because whether or
not you could view an ad for housing depended on your race or your skin
color.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> Facebook managed to settle the issue by ensuring that anyone <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18273018/facebook-housing-ads-jobs-discrimination-settlement" target="_blank">"placing housing, job, or credit ads will not be able to target users by age,
gender, or zip code."</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. But why does Facebook get to decide that?</p>

<p>Ubuhle should have advertising, with crystal-clear controls over what
information you do and do not wish to share with advertisers.</p>

<p>You can even <em>opt out</em> of the advertising entirely. That's what
trust is all about.</p>

<p>But why allow advertising at all? For the final quarter of 2018, <a href="https://martechtoday.com/despite-ongoing-criticism-facebook-generates-16-6-billion-in-ad-revenue-during-q4-up-30-yoy-230261" target="_blank">Facebook&lsquo;s ad revenue was $16.6 <em>billion</em> dollars.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, with 93% of
that coming from mobile advertising.</p>

<figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/mewe-emojis.png" width="600" alt="An advertisement for cartoon-emojis being sold by mewe.com">
    <figcaption>I'm unsure how they'll earn $16.6 billion in revenue selling emojis.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Meanwhile, Tim Berners-Lee's offering, MeWe, doesn't allow ads but is
selling cartoon icon sets at $4.99 each. You do the math.</p>

<p>And let's be honest: well-done ads can be brilliant.</p>

<div class="video-responsive">
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1KiAtVVcOw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


<p>There are plenty of other ways to earn money, but advertising is the key.
What would set Ubuhle apart is giving users total control over that
advertising.</p>

<p>And if the user wants to use an ad blockers? That's fine. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xydvx/facebooks-arms-race-with-adblockers-continues-to-escalate" target="_blank">there is no need to waste time or money on an adblocking arms race.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<h1><a name="can-it-happen"></a>Can It Happen?</h1>

<p>Yes, it can. Frankly, <a href="https://allaroundtheworld.fr/" target="_blank">we
would love to do it</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, but we have to be realistic. This would be a
long-term, cash-intensive project. Between our client work and building <a href="https://taustation.space/" target="_blank">Tau Station</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, our free narrative
RPG, we are not in a position to do this without major funding. If we don't do
this, someone should. Hence, putting this information out there.</p>

<p>But as Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes made clear in this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html" target="_blank">Time to Break up Facebook</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> article:</p>

<blockquote>...would-be competitors can’t raise the money to take on Facebook.
Investors realize that if a company gets traction, Facebook will copy its
innovations, shut it down or acquire it for a relatively modest sum. So
despite an extended economic expansion, increasing interest in high-tech
start-ups, an explosion of venture capital and growing public distaste for
Facebook, no major social networking company has been founded since the fall
of 2011.</blockquote>

<p>Investors are afraid. None of the competition has really done anything
particularly different from Facebook, aside from no advertising, no
censorship, and no chance. Ubuhle would be establishing a pact with its
customers: you get full control and, in exchange, we work with you to build a
community of trust.</p>

<p>Building the business would start with targeting the valuable <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2019/03/06/tech/exclusive-look-numbers-showing-users-leaving-facebook-by-the-millions/" target="_blank">12 to 35 year old demographic that&lsquo;s leaving Facebook</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. It would
take a serious marketing campaign, probably combined with an attempt to swing
"influencers" over to the new GPSN.</p>

<p>Leveraging network effects will also be key. Ubuhle would need a strong
API, preferably one that is similar to the Facebook API<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-11"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> to accomodate those developers already familiar
with Facebook. Being able to add their apps to Ubuhle would help it grow with
less effort.  Widgets will also be a key part of this. Having tools on your
web site such as "Login with Ubuhle", "Share on Ubuhle", "Ubuhle profile
badges", and so on.</p>

<p>And, of course, there's the question of scale. There's a lot I could say on
this topic, but that's turning to the technical side instead of the business
side, so that's a different conversation. However, it needs to be well-planned
because <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/cost-to-fix-bugs-during-each-sdlc-phase/" target="_blank">catching bugs in the design phase is one of the best ways to keep costs
down</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>None of this is cheap, <a href="/articles/estimating-development-costs-is-almost-useless.html">but the long-term value is what&lsquo;s imporant, not the development
costs.</a>. However, it involves a commitment of years to have the chance to
offer solid competition to Facebook and no one wants to take them on. But
creating competition to Facebook is important, so this is offered as a chance
to get discussion going. I spent weeks digging through information to come up
with all of this and at times, it was unpleasant work (the livestreaming
research particularly turned my stomach). But we <em>need</em> this. Sooner or
later, someone's going to take Facebook down. Sooner is better; even the
co-founders agree.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/why-google-failed-4b9db05b973b" target="_blank">One of the engineers who worked on Google+ offers
some great insight as to why it failed.</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></p>
