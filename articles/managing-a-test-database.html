<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>Test databases are very easy to get wrong. Very easy. Decades ago when I first
learned testing, the team shared a test database. If you ran your test at
the same time another developer, both of your test suites would fail!
However, we were using a database where we had to pay for individual licenses,
so we were limited in what we could do.</p>

<p>Later, I worked for a company using MySQL and I created an elaborate system of
triggers to track all database changes. This let me “fake” transactions by
starting a test run, see what had changed last time, and automatically
reverting those changes. It had the advantage that multiple database handles
could see each other’s changes (hard to do for many databases if you have
separate transactions). It had the disadvantage of everything else: it was
fragile and slow.</p>

<p>Later, I started using xUnit frameworks, <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Class::Moose" target="_blank">eventually writing a new
one</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> that’s popular for companies
needing a large-scale testing solution. With this, it was easy for each test
class to run in a separate transaction, cleaning itself up as it went. Using
transactions provides great isolation, leverages what databases are already
good at, and let’s you run many classes in parallel.</p>

<p>But it can easily break embedded transaction logic. And you have to guarantee
everything shares the same database handle, and you can’t really test the
transactions in your code, and, and, and ...</p>

<p>What finally drove me over the edge was writing some code for a client using
the <a href="https://github.com/mojolicious/minion" target="_blank">Minion job queue</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. The queue is
solid, but it creates new database connections, thus ensuring that it can’t
see anything in your database transactions. I figured out a (hackish)
solution, but I was tired of hackish solutions.</p>

<p>While I was researching the solution, Matt Trout was reminding me (again) why
the “database transactions for tests” approach was broken. Just spawn off
temporary test databases and use those, throwing them away when you’re done.</p>

<h1>The Client</h1>

<p>So a company wanting to hire me gave me a technical test and there was a task
to add a small, simple feature to a <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/" target="_blank">Catalyst web
application</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. It was trivial.  They handed
me a Vagrant file and after a quick <code>vagrant up</code> and <code>vagrant ssh</code>, I was
ready to begin.  Then I looked at the test they had for the controller:</p>

<pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">use strict;
use warnings;
use Test::More;

use Catalyst::Test 'Client';

ok( request('/some_path')-&gt;is_success, 'Request should succeed' );
done_testing();
</code></pre>

<p>The task involved a <code>POST</code> to a URL. There was no test for the existing feature
that I was adding to, but any test I wrote meant I’d be changing the state of
the database. Run the code multiple times and I’d leave junk in the database.
There were various ways I could approach this, but I decided it was time to build
a quick database on the fly, write to that, and then dispose of it after. The
code for this was trivial:</p>

<pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">package Test::DB;

use File::Temp qw(tempfile);
use DBI;
use parent 'Exporter';
use Client::Policy;

BEGIN {
    if ( exists $INC{'Client/Model/ClientDB.pm'} ) {
        croak(&quot;You must load Test::DB before Client::Model::ClientDB&quot;);
    }
}
use Client::Model::ClientDB;

our @EXPORT_OK = qw(test_dbh);

my $connect_info = Client::Model::ClientDB-&gt;config-&gt;{connect_info};
my $dsn          = $connect_info-&gt;{dsn};
my $user         = $connect_info-&gt;{user};
my $password     = $connect_info-&gt;{password};

# $$ is the process id (PID)
my $db_name = sprintf 'test_db_%d_%d', time, $$;
my ( $fh, $filename ) = tempfile();

my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(
    $dsn, $user, $password,
    { RaiseError =&gt; 1, AutoCommit =&gt; 1 } 
);
$dbh-&gt;do(&quot;CREATE DATABASE $db_name&quot;);
system(&quot;mysqldump -u $user --password=$password test_db &gt; $filename&quot;) == 0
  or croak(&quot;mysqldump failed: $?&quot;);
system(&quot;mysql -u $user --password=$password $db_name &lt; $filename&quot;) == 0
  or croak(&quot;importing schema to mysql failed: $?&quot;);

# XXX We’re being naughty in this quick hack. We’re writing
# this back to the Model so that modules which use this connect 
# to the correct database.
$connect_info-&gt;{dsn} = &quot;dbi:mysql:$db_name&quot;;

# This is just a quick hack to get tests working for this code.
# A catastrophic failure in the test means this might not get
# run and we have a junk test database lying around.
# Obviously we want something far more robust

END { $dbh-&gt;do(&quot;DROP DATABASE $db_name&quot;) }

sub test_dbh () { $dbh }

1;
</code></pre>

<p>The above is very naughty in many ways, but the client hinted that how fast I
returned the test might be a factor (or maybe they didn’t and I misread the
signals). They also made it clear they were looking at how I approached problems,
not whether or not the code was perfect. Thus, I thought I was on safe territory.
And it meant I could do this in my test:</p>

<pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">use strict;
use warnings;
use Test::More;
use lib 't/lib';
use Test::DB;

use Catalyst::Test 'Client';

ok( request('/some_path')-&gt;is_success, 'Request should succeed' );

# anything I do here is against a temporary test database
# and will be discarded when the test finishes

done_testing();
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Test::DB</code> code was quick and easy to write and made it trivial for me
to safely write tests. I was pleased.</p>

<h1>What’s Wrong With Test::DB?</h1>

<p>For a junior developer, <code>Test::DB</code> might look awesome. For an experienced
developer, it’s terrible. So what would I do to make it closer to production
ready?</p>

<p>Here are just a few of the things I would consider.</p>

<h2>Stronger Data Validation</h2>

<p>First, let’s look at our connection information:</p>

<pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">my $connect_info = Client::Model::ClientDB-&gt;config-&gt;{connect_info};
my $dsn          = $connect_info-&gt;{dsn};
my $user         = $connect_info-&gt;{user};
my $password     = $connect_info-&gt;{password};
</code></pre>

<p>The above relied on how Catalyst often sets up its DBIx::Class (a Perl ORM) model:</p>

<pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">package Client::Model::ClientDB;

use strict;
use base 'Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema';

__PACKAGE__-&gt;config(
    schema_class =&gt; 'Client::Schema::ClientDB',
    connect_info =&gt; {
        dsn      =&gt; 'dbi:mysql:test_db',
        user     =&gt; 'root',
        password =&gt; 'rootpass',
    }
);
</code></pre>

<p>Once you load that class, you get a <code>config</code> class method which can tell you
how that class is configured. However, there’s no guarantee in the <code>Test::DB</code>
side that the data is structured the way that I expect. Thus, I need to validate
that data and throw an exception immediately if something has changed.</p>

<p>And how do we create our test database?</p>

<pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">$dbh-&gt;do(&quot;CREATE DATABASE $db_name&quot;);
system(&quot;mysqldump -u $user --password=$password test_db &gt; $filename&quot;) == 0
  or croak(&quot;mysqldump failed: $?&quot;);
system(&quot;mysql -u $user --password=$password $db_name &lt; $filename&quot;) == 0
  or croak(&quot;importing schema to mysql failed: $?&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>CREATE DATABASE</code> command is fast, so I’m not worried about that.  And the
test had a single table with very little data, so this was quick. But for <a href="https://taustation.space/" target="_blank">Tau
Station</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, we have a couple of hundred tables and
tons of data. This would be slow. For any reasonably mature system, dumping
the database each time would be a bad idea. There are also ways you could
easily avoid dumping it multiple times, but that hits the next problem: adding
that data to your new test database. That would need to be done for each test
and <em>that</em> is not something you can trivially speed up.</p>

<p>For a more robust system, I’d probably create a local database service
that would simply build a set number of test databases and have them waiting.
The test would request the next test database, the service would regist that
the database had been taken, and create a new test database in the background
while your test runs. The service would also probably clean up old test
databases based on whatever policies you think are appropriate.</p>

<h1>No Action At A Distance</h1>

<p>This line is terrible:</p>

<pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">$connect_info-&gt;{dsn} = &quot;dbi:mysql:$db_name&quot;;
</code></pre>

<p>The reason that works is because the <code>config</code> data in
<code>Client::Model::ClientDB</code> is global <em>and</em> mutable and <code>$connect_info</code> is
merely a reference to that data. Instead, if I have a "database service" that
tells the code which database it can use, then <code>Test::DB</code> can call that
service, and so can <code>Client::Model::ClientDB</code>. Everything relies on a single
source of truth instead of hacking global variables and hoping you don’t mess
up.</p>

<h1>Don’t Drop The Test Database</h1>

<p>If there is one thing which I hate about many testing systems, it’s a watching
a test horribly fail, but the database is cleaned up (or dropped) and I can’t
see the actual data after the test is done. What I often have to do is fire up
the debugger and run the code up to the test failure and grab a database
handle and try to inspect the data that way. It’s a mess.</p>

<p>Here, we can fix that by simply dropping this line:</p>

<pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">END { $dbh-&gt;do(&quot;DROP DATABASE $db_name&quot;) }
</code></pre>

<p>At the beginning and end of every test run, we can <code>diag</code> the test database
name and if I need to see if there’s an issue in the database, I can still use
it. Our database service would have code to drop the database on:</p>

<ul>
<li>The next day</li>
<li>The next test run</li>
<li>After exceeding a threshold of databases</li>
<li>... or whatever else you need</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, keep the valuable data around for debugging.</p>

<h1>Rapid Database Development</h1>

<p>The database service solution would also have to tie into your database
change management strategy. I heavily use <a href="https://sqitch.org/" target="_blank">sqitch</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> to
manage database changes and I’ve written a lot of code to support odd edge
cases. It wouldn’t be hard to write code to let the database service see if
it’s up to date with your local version of <code>sqitch</code>. Whatever database change
management strategy you use, it needs to be discoverable to properly automate
the database service. </p>

<p>Of course, you think, that’s obvious. Yet you’d be shocked how many times I’ve
worked with clients whose database change management strategy involves listing
a bunch of SQL files and checking their <code>mtime</code> to see which ones need to be
applied to your database. Yikes!</p>

<h1>Faster Tests</h1>

<p>If this is done well, your tests should also be faster. You won’t have the
overhead of transactions beyond what your code already has. Plus, you can
avoid issues like this:</p>

<pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">sub test_basic_combat_attack_behavior ($test,$) {
    my $ovid    = $test-&gt;load_fixture('character.ovid');
    my $winston = $test-&gt;load_fixture('character.winston');
    my $station = $test-&gt;load_fixture('station.tau-station');

    $test-&gt; move_to($station-&gt;port, $ovid, $winston);
    ok !$ovid-&gt;attack($winston),
      'We should not be able to attack someone on the home station.';
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the above, we’re loading some fixtures. Sometimes those fixtures are very
complicated and loading them takes time. For one client, when I would run
<code>$test-&gt;load_all_fixtures('connection');</code>, that would add an extra couple of
seconds to every test which needed to do that.</p>

<p>Instead, pre-built test databases can have the test fixtures already loaded.
Further, having a pre-populated database helps your code deal with something
closer to a real-world problem instead of dealing with an empty database and
not catching corner cases that might cause.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>By using a database service which merely hands you a temporary test database,
you don’t have to worry about leaving the database a mess, managing
transactions in tests, or having nasty hacks in your tests to workaround these
issues. Most importantly, you’re not changing the behavior of your code. You
just use the database like normal. It might be a little bit more work up front
to create that database, but it’s worth the effort.</p>

<p>I really do want to get around to creating a proper database tool like this
some day. Today is not that day. But I was delighted how even my quick hack,
written in just a couple of minutes, made it so much easier to test my code. I
should have done this ages ago.</p>
