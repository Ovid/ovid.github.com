<h1><a name="i-wrecked-the-interview"></a>I Wrecked the Interview</h1>

<p>The interview was going well. Questions were asked and answered and we were all
smiling. But the interviewers kept talking about their company’s transformation
into “microservices” but were awfully vague about it. So I asked them how they
defined microservices.</p>

<p>The interview was no longer going well. The company had issued a directive that
they were going to break up the monolith into microservices, but no one agreed
on what microservices were. I got the contract.</p>

<p>This was not the first time this happened to me.</p>

<h1><a name="defining-microservices"></a>Defining Microservices</h1>

<p>Microservices seems to be the “buzzword du jour” (after AI). When I mention
microservices online, almost invariably I have people chime in that “the
architecture is too complex,” “it’s just a fad,” “they don’t solve the real
business problems,” and so on.</p>

<p>Those complaints are often right, but that doesn’t mean microservices
don’t provide value. But to get to that value, we need a working definition.
I’ll provide one that is short, sweet, and will be objectionable to
some. We’ll also skip the differences between microservices and SOA because the
latter also has plenty of contradictory descriptions, some of whom curiously
resemble microservices.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A microservice is a small, self-contained process which exposes an API to
  solve a single business need.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, not helpful. Too vague. In actual practice, here are a few more things
to consider.</p>

<p>The processes can be on the same or different servers. The API is often exposed
via OpenAPI and typically uses REST, EDA (event-driven architectures), or
WebSockets, depending on the need. GraphQL is also sometimes in the mix.
Different services are loosely coupled (in theory) and communicate by sending
data back and forth.  There is no directly shared memory, though state is often
shared via data stores.</p>

<p>OK, so that’s far too brief and entire books can be written on the topic, but
this is a blog post. Are they a good idea or not?</p>

<h1><a name="should-you-choose-microservices"></a>Should You Choose Microservices?</h1>

<p>Enter Shahina Abadi, the brand-new CTO of Mechanical Tendencies,<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> an online
machine parts supplier. She’s been brought in because their legacy platform is
struggling and their SAFe® agile project failed, turning out to be <a href="https://jeffgothelf.com/blog/safe-is-not-agile/" target="_blank">neither
safe nor
agile</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. Now she
has people arguing over cloud-first, containerization, and microservices as
some of the approaches that can save the company. How is she going to decide?</p>

<p>There’s much Abadi can do and one of those things is to isolate the underlying
problem(s), determine what can be fixed, and how various approaches are going
to fix them. What are the risks and benefits to the customers, company,
vendors, and employees? Are the various approaches complementary or not? Can
they be done in isolation, prioritizing greater benefits first? We’ll just look
at microservices.</p>

<h2><a name="benefits-of-microservices"></a>Benefits of Microservices</h2>

<p>Advocates of microservices tout their benefits, but often downplay the
drawbacks. Let’s talk about the benefits first.</p>

<h3><a name="scalability"></a>Scalability</h3>

<p>One of the most cited benefits is scalability. If you’re running a
monolith and one part of your code is bogging down the system, scaling that
often means scaling everything, regardless of whether or not it needs it. That
can quickly get expensive. With microservices, if you find that your reservation
service is slow, you can often just scale up that service. Move it to a beefier
server or move its data store to a beefier server. There’s no need to spend the
money on faster hardware for everything.</p>

<h3><a name="learning-the-code-base"></a>Learning the Code Base</h3>

<p>For one project I was on, with a monolithic code base of tens of millions of
lines of code, I found that the authentication system we were building was
sometimes throwing a “method not found” exception. Lots of digging through logs
and exploring code paths later, I found that, far, far away from my code,
someone had created a custom “user” object which only provided the two methods
they needed. It was being passed to my code. I later found tons of user
objects, lovingly hand-crafted for different parts of the system, all of which
presented different behaviors and different bugs. It was a mess, but
given the size of the codebase, there was no reasonable way our team could have
anticipated this up front. You become more productive by learning the entire
code base, but that’s not possible.</p>

<p>With microservices, you only need to learn the code for your service, and the
contracts provided by the services you interact with. All of a sudden, a huge,
intractable problem becomes manageable.</p>

<h3><a name="gradual-migration"></a>Gradual Migration</h3>

<p>In the year 2000, Joel Spolsky wrote a famous blog post entitled, <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/" target="_blank">Things You
Should Never Do, Part
1</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
Two decades later, we’re still waiting for part 2, but part 1 says you should <em>never</em>
rewrite an existing application. Today we know that’s not true, but only because
we have new patterns which allow us to do this and a microservice is one of
those patterns. Yes, you might call it “refactoring”
instead.</p>

<p>I won’t begrudge the correction, but microservices allow you to tear
chunks out of your monolith, piece by piece. You can even stop and leave the
remainder of the monolith in place if your approach is wrong, or if the
remainder is “good enough.” With this strategy, you always have working code and
you can take small steps forward. One approach, the unfortunately-named
<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strangler-pattern-in-micro-services-system-design/" target="_blank">strangler
pattern</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
is great when you’re first dipping your toe in the microservice waters.</p>

<h3><a name="its-all-data"></a>It’s All Data</h3>

<p>When Alan Kay talks about OO programming, he thinks we got things wrong about
objects. For him the key benefits are <a href="/articles/alan-kay-and-oo-programming.html">messaging, isolation, and extreme
late-binding</a>. While microservices
can provide all of these benefits, for this point, we’ll talk about messaging.
You send a message to a service (<code>GET /products/{productId}</code>) and the service
sends back a message, often in the form of a JSON data structure.
It might be another service. In a monolith, the analogous code
might get a reference to data back and if it’s mutable, you can wind up with
strange action at a distance. Having <a href="/articles/using-immutable-datetime-objects-with-dbixclass.html">mutable data is a constant source of bugs
in your code</a>.</p>

<p>When you’re sending a stream of data and not using shared memory, whole classes
of bugs go away. You don’t need to worry as much about mutating an incoming
data structure because you know the sender won’t be affected. Because we’re
only sending data back and forth, you can minimize action at a distance.</p>

<h3><a name="asynchronous-code"></a>Asynchronous Code</h3>

<p>In legacy monolith systems, calls to other parts of the code tend to be
blocking. It’s not always a big deal because with everything running in the
same process, you can do deep work to resolve performance bottlenecks. However,
this comes at the cost of making the code more complex.</p>

<p>With microservices, calls are often asynchronous, minimizing blockage. You can
fire off requests to several services at once, requesting a response or a
change, and aggregate the results when they complete. Asynchronous requests,
when possible, can do a fantastic job of taking a load off a server.</p>

<h3><a name="new-business-products"></a>New Business Products</h3>

<p>When you can start isolating different business concerns into microservices,
those services might become stand-alone products you can expose to customers.
Some of those customers might be internal.  For one client, I rewrote how they
generated search results to return a JSON data structure instead of an HTML
document. Afterwards, one of their mobile developers thanked me. For years they
provided limited search results because the HTML document was useless to them.
By being able to request JSON, they said it took them 15 minutes to have a
brand new, much more useful search engine on mobile. Well-designed services
give <em>flexibility</em>.</p>

<h3><a name="partial-failures"></a>Partial Failures</h3>

<p>In a monolith, an unexpected exception can often result in the dreaded <code>500 -
Internal Server Error</code> being sent to a browser. With microservices, you often
see a degradation in services instead of a complete failure. Maybe your
recommendation system doesn’t show a list of related products for a while. The
software itself still runs!</p>

<h3><a name="the-darkest-secret"></a>The Darkest Secret</h3>

<p>It’s one that not everyone is happy with, but sometimes your beloved
programming language isn’t the best choice for a given task. Maybe you need
your authentication system to be lightning fast and you can’t risk bugs. When it’s
safely encapsulated behind an OpenAPI front end, you can consider rewriting the
implementation in a faster, more secure language. This one shouldn’t be
controversial, but many developers are proud of the languages they prefer and
suggesting that it’s not the best tool for the job rankles them, but our job
isn’t to provide a particular programming language, it’s to provide solutions.
A solid microservice system with services isolated behind well-defined APIs
gives us possibilities to transform the system in ways we never
thought possible. It’s a huge benefit that should not be overlooked.</p>

<h2><a name="drawbacks-of-microservices"></a>Drawbacks of Microservices</h2>

<p>Given the benefits of microservices, you might think it insane to not switch to
them. But there’s a cost to everything and those costs need to be taken into
account.</p>

<h3><a name="infrastructure"></a>Infrastructure</h3>

<p>So you’ve decided that the first microservice you want to create is for
authentication. You’ve already got feature switches in place so your
<code>authenticate( user, pass )</code> method looks like this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-python">def authenticate (self, username, password):
    if feature_running('auth_service'):
        # use authentication service
    else:
        # use monolithic code
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, if something goes wrong, just switch off the feature and fix it.</p>

<p>But how do you get the authentication service running in the first place? How
do you dispatch to it? How do you deploy it? Using the strangler pattern can
allow you to take a small, isolated bit of code and transform it into a
service, but there has to be something for it to run on. So now you’re looking
at something like <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-the-api-gateway-pattern/" target="_blank">the gateway
pattern</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> to
dispatch to your new service and you have to deal with the complexity <em>that</em>
introduces. There are many yaks you’ll need to shave before you can solve this
problem.</p>

<h3><a name="monitoring-and-debugging"></a>Monitoring and Debugging</h3>

<p>Oops. Something failed. Hard. Everything is humming along nicely, but nobody
can buy your products. Maybe they get a confirmation of purchase.
Maybe they’ve been charged for the purchase. But no inventory was deducted or
scheduled to be sent. So it’s the purchase service, right? Maybe not. Maybe
there was an unexpected failure in your authentication service. Maybe your product
service went down. Maybe there was something else going on.</p>

<p>Now you realized you needed better monitoring and nobody thought about log
aggregation. The logs are there, but you can’t connect an individual service’s
logs to the logs of the services which called it! If your monitoring systems
weren’t great before, they need to be now, to surface issues quickly. Log
aggregation is also critical. When you have a failed request, you want to have
a full log reply of everything for that request show up on a single
page/console/file/whatever. There are COTS tools to let you do this. You
want them.</p>

<p>One the upside, one benefit of microservices is that you can deploy your service
without waiting for the “weekly” release (or whatever the time frame is). As a
result, when something goes wrong, you can often spot when it went wrong and
while you might not know what caused it, you can check what was deployed and
you’ll often see a much smaller set of code deployed, making many bugs easier to
track down.</p>

<h3><a name="communication-overhead"></a>Communication Overhead</h3>

<p>This one’s a huge issue. Now, instead of me passing a user object and a
purchase request into a method, I have to send a message with the relevant
data to a service. A service, which in turn, is probably sending messages to
other services, which might be sending messages to other services, and so on.
You might worry about cycles in the data calls, but in reality, they’re no
worse than this possibility in a monolithic code base. No, the problem is that
you’re now generating much more internal network traffic than you did
previously. This is a trade-off that is often acceptable, but it needs to be
known up front and dealt with. You might need to buy new hardware to deal with
this.</p>

<h3><a name="data-consistency"></a>Data Consistency</h3>

<p>Many developers might be nodding along at many of these points, until they come
to the hill they’re willing to die on. The following has been my hill and it’s
probably the most challenging aspect of microservices (for me).</p>

<p>I teach developers how to design databases.</p>

<div class="video-responsive">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y1tcbhWLiUM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>It’s a thankless task because developers get this wrong so often and I’ve
noticed an interesting pattern. When I go into clients using PostgreSQL, their
database is usually in decent shape. That’s because developers who choose
PostgreSQL often understand and even obsess over data quality. MySQL fans,
however, often obsess about ease of use. When I go into a client who uses
MySQL, I often find it doesn’t use strict mode, or if it does, they’re often
sloppy about <code>NULL</code> values or foreign key (FK) constraints. When I find a
database not using FK constraints, I look for dangling records and I have
<em>never</em> found a large database skipping FK constraints which doesn’t have
dangling data, unconnected to anything else, or ids pointing to records which
no longer exist.</p>

<p>I have to admit that this is helpful for me. It means I sometimes get paid more
to fix these bugs, until the client points out that yeah, it’s a problem, but
not a serious one. Despite data integrity issues, in many cases, clients
consider ease of use to be a fair trade off. I’ll go cry into my beer, but I
need to rethink my absolutist position about data integrity. Maybe
I’ll eventually come around to eventual consistency.</p>

<p>If you’re breaking up a monolithic codebase, but you decide to stick with a
monolithic database, you have a potential bottleneck. The code will be easier to
maintain, but the scaling promises aren’t kept. Large databases can be
<em>hard</em> to scale. Large transactions can guarantee ACID compliance at the cost of
potentially blocking, something you’re trying to avoid with microservices.</p>

<p>So many microservice strategies involve creating micro data services, each with
their tiny, backend data store. That’s a problem if you’re buying licences for
proprietary systems such as Oracle. It’s also a problem when people object to
eventual consistency, even though they don’t need perfectly up-to-date
information, such as for a product search.</p>

<p>However, if you’re doing financial transactions, there are plenty of places
where eventual consistency is not acceptable, so you’ll have to feel your own
way here.</p>

<h3><a name="other-drawbacks"></a>Other Drawbacks</h3>

<p>Microservices create issues with testing complexity, deployments, dependency
management, security management, permanent operational overheard, and the
initial development effort. They’re not a step to take lightly, though if my
past experience is anything to go on, many companies look at the benefits,
ignore the costs, and don’t have a clear plan of attack.</p>

<h1><a name="complexity"></a>Complexity</h1>

<p>For the drawbacks of microservices, once you read through them, many of them go
away or are diminished after the first microservices are successfully launched.
Unfortunately, the added complexity of the system will always be there and this
is where the critical argument lies.</p>

<p>When I first learned to program, back in the 80s, I wrote something like this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code>10 PRINT &quot;HELLO, WORLD!&quot;
20 GOTO 10
</code></pre></div>

<p>Needless to say, as our business demands grow, the complexity of our software
grows, too. CGI, which would have been unthinkably complex to me in the 80s, is
unthinkably simplistic in dealing with modern requirements. We have greater
needs and with that comes greater complexity. So let’s take a diversion.</p>

<h2><a name="the-bbc-atlas-project"></a>The BBC “Atlas” Project</h2>

<p>I worked for the BBC for several years. Were it not for the fact that my wife
and I had decided we didn’t want to raise our child in London, I might still be
there. I <em>loved</em> working for the BBC.</p>

<p>One day they announced the Atlas project. As a rule of thumb, when a company
announces a grand project named “Atlas,” “Leviathon,” “V2,” and so on, looking
for a new job becomes a serious option. Atlas was no different (today, I don’t
know, but then, it was a mess).</p>

<p>The Atlas project stemmed out of a simple problem: the BBC used tons of
different programming languages and it was getting harder to find developers
for them, or to train developers for those systems. So the BBC decreed that all
backend development would be in Java and all front-end development would be in
PHP.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-2"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<p>On the Atlas internal mailing list, an experienced PHP developer
complained that he couldn’t figure out how to run “Hello, World!” on the new
framework that had been built. No matter how many times he read the
instructions, he couldn’t get it working. The admins held his hand and walked
him through the process, but it was a mess. When I pointed out that running
“Hello, World!” shouldn’t be so difficult that a senior developer can’t figure
it out, one of the admins privately sent me an email telling me that obviously I
didn’t know how to write code that scaled.</p>

<p>This is part of the issue with emerging complexity. When it
first arrives, we’re not sure of the best way to manage it. Microservices, in
the grand scheme of things, are still relatively new. We’re going to find new
patterns to manage them (a future blog post) and new ways of hiding the
complexity behind abstractions. This fits with the history of programming.
Subroutines and pushing their arguments to the stack were a “design pattern”
until they became first class constructs. Memory management was manual and
painful until mark and sweep, reference counting, and other imperfect tools
came along to make it automatic. Rust is now blowing the doors off of them.</p>

<p>Microservices will undergo the same process. Many common patterns will become
first class constructs.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-3"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> It
will take many years, perhaps a generation or more, until we better understand
how to manage the new complexities.</p>

<p>But are they worth it? Alan Kay states that the internet is the only large scale
OOP system which matches his expectations. If a server goes down, your browser
doesn’t spontaneously crash; you find another server. Kay was thinking about the
robustness of biological systems. You have <em>billions</em> of cells in your body die
every day, but you don’t. We evolved over billions of years to a robustness we
can only dream of for software. Microservices are yet another attempt to get
closer to that robustness.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, a key takeaway is not that the “everything” is more 
complex. It’s that it’s a trade-off. In exchange for architectural complexity, 
you have software that’s easier to maintain and services that are easier to 
scale.</p>

<h1><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1>

<p>All systems become more complex over time. Whether or not the benefits of
microservices override the drawbacks of their added complexity is not something
I can answer for you, but I hope this has given you a starting point for
understanding the trade offs.</p>

<p>I don’t think suggesting microservices is a great fit until the company truly
needs this kind of scalability (and perhaps breaking down of a monolith) and is
100% committed to it. <a href="/articles/estimating-development-costs-is-almost-useless.html">The actual development costs aren’t the important
argument</a> here.
Of course, if
microservices are the course a company decides, they had damned well be able to
tell the team what they mean by them. I’ll be able to avoid future interview
fiascos that way.</p>

<p>If you’d like to see a deeper dive into handling microservices at scale, here’s
a great video about how Netflix handles them.</p>
