<h1><a name="why-leave-oracle"></a>Why Leave Oracle?</h1>

<blockquote>Oracle is the fast, beastly sports car that will quickly outpace that Honda
Accord you’re driving ... so long as the sports car has an expert driver,
constant maintenance, and an expensive, highly-trained pit crew to look after
it.
<div class="attribution"><a href="/articles/project-500.html">Source</a></div>
</blockquote>

<p>A couple of decades ago I was working for a company that was using Oracle on
Linux. At the time, this was unusual, though becoming more common. It was a
time when open source software was still looked upon with mistrust, so while
we told our investors we used Oracle, we didn’t trumpet the fact that we used
Linux.</p>

<p>One day we discovered a problem. An Oracle <code
class="language-sql">SELECT</code> statement was sometimes returning different
results. The query in question was extremely complex, but the results should
not have changed as the underlying data was static. After much debugging, the
company gave up trying to solve the issue and called Oracle. We were informed
that while Oracle could run on Linux, it needed to be Red Hat Advanced Server.</p>

<p>So we switched to Red Hat Advanced Server. And the bug was still there.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;No, you need be on version X of Red Hat Advanced server.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>So we switched to version X of Red Hat Advanced Server. And the bug was still there.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;No, you need be on version X, point release Y, of Red Hat Advanced server.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>So we switched to version X, point release Y of Red Hat Advanced Server. And the bug was still there.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;That’s a known bug. We&rsquo;re working on it.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Words were said. They were not nice words.</p>

<h2><a name="time-has-not-been-kind-to-oracle"></a>Time Has Not Been Kind to Oracle</h2>

<p>In the early 2000s, switching from Oracle to PostgreSQL was a gamble.  Today
we’ve had several clients making the switch or in the process of it, but what
holds them back is no longer “can we trust PostgreSQL?“, it’s “our entire
technology stack assumes Oracle.”</p>

<p>And the driver behind the switch? It’s invariably Oracle’s insane costs with
no clear return on investment for most companies. But there are plenty of
technical reasons, too. Oracle DDL is not transaction safe.  <span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> Oracle violates the ANSI standard by often
treating empty strings as <code>NULL</code>, causing all sorts of subtle bugs. And Oracle
was built in an ASCII world, not a Unicode one, and it shows, painfully.</p>

<h2><a name="added-benefits-of-postgresql"></a>Added Benefits of PostgreSQL</h2>

<p>First, PostgreSQL is generally chosen as the migration target due to its
strong compatibility with Oracle and its excellent data handling. Fortunately,
it’s now easy to find PostgreSQL admins (as opposed to Oracle admins) in the
wild because PostgreSQL is both open source and free, so it’s much easier for
a would-be DBA to get experience with the stack. In fact, one of our DBAs
commented:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I never met anyone who knew how to use Oracle RAC (and debug its problems)
  unless they had already endured the hell of a broken Oracle RAC installation
  at least once ... on someone’s production server.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cloud support for PostgreSQL is fantastic, with Amazon, Azure, and Google all
supporting PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>And because PostgreSQL is SQL-92 (and increasingly, SQL-99 compliant) with an
open extension library, its geospatial tooling and JSON support are arguably
much stronger than Oracle’s. If you need those tools, you save a ton of money
<em>and</em> get a better product.</p>

<h1><a name="starting-the-process"></a>Starting the Process</h1>

<p>As with any project of this scope, you need to start out with a solid plan and
that plan starts with a problem statement clearly outlining:</p>

<ol>
<li>The problem you are trying to solve.</li>
<li>Why you want to solve the problem.</li>
<li>What your proposed solution is.</li>
<li><em>Measurable</em> success criteria.</li>
<li>A SWOT analysis (or something comparable).</li>
</ol>

<p>While points 1 through 3 are the most straightforward, it’s worth considering
unusual ways of meeting your goals. For example, merely contacting Oracle and
explaining that you’re considering leaving Oracle for a more affordable
solutions might get enough of a discount on licensing that you don’t feel the
immediate pressure to migrate. High-profile companies, or organizations that
hook people young (such as universities) can often command hefty discounts.</p>

<p>You may also find that hiring an expert to review licensing is worthwhile. For
example, hot standby servers need licensing, but cold standby with minimal use
may not. Or you may find yourself paying for too many licenses because you
have separate databases which can be merged, or you may find yourself paying
for too many CPUs when a more powerful server may be a more cost-effective
solution.</p>

<p>There are also many edge cases to consider. One company we know uses Oracle
for a public facing application so that they can reassure investors that “they
use Oracle”, but use PostgreSQL exclusively for everything internal.</p>

<p>Or there are the cases where clients use Oracle Enterprise applications but
find many internal cases where they’re unnecessarily spending on Oracle
licenses. The Enterprise applications are often difficult to extricate from,
while individual applications still eat up enormous costs for no valid reason.</p>

<h2><a name="success-criteria"></a>Success Criteria</h2>

<p>However, it’s points 4 and 5 above (success criteria and SWOT analysis) that
we find many clients don’t address. For example, the success criteria needs
to be <em>measurable</em> and you should be able to address:</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance</li>
<li>Functional requirements</li>
<li>Schedule</li>
<li>Budgeting</li>
<li>Resource allocation</li>
<li>Minimized disruption</li>
</ul>

<p>All of those will need flexibility when you encounter surprising obstacles to
the migration. Resource allocation is particularly important if you are
partway through a migration and find yourself maintaining Oracle and
PostgreSQL systems simultaneously. This is where having a dedicated team to
oversee the process is helpful because they are focused on successful delivery
and are less likely to be pulled away on internal “distractions” that arise
throughout the migration process.</p>

<h2><a name="swot-analysis"></a>SWOT Analysis</h2>

<p>A <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swot.asp" target="_blank">SWOT
analysis</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> is simply a listing of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities
and Threats. For example, a clear strength of moving to PostgreSQL is the
significant cost savings. Weaknesses may include poor internal knowledge of
PostgreSQL. Opportunities can involve the custom data types and DDL-safe
transactions, while threats might involve a need for write-heavy multi-master
replication.</p>

<p>The above weaknesses or threats can be addressed, but you need to understand
them and plan for them up front, with a signicant focus on mitigating
weaknesses and threats.</p>

<h1><a name="developing-a-migration-plan"></a>Developing a Migration Plan</h1>

<p>The migration plan that you develop will need to be fine-tuned for how your
company operates, so a “one-size fits all” plan is not possible to develop.
However, a successful migration plan should generally include the following
steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Audit</li>
<li>Planning</li>
<li>Migration</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Adjusting</li>
<li>Deployment</li>
<li>Rollback</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="1-audit"></a>1. Audit</h2>

<p>The audit stage starts with identifying every area in your organization where
Oracle is used, identifying all licenses and expirations (you may need to
renew during the migration process), and <em>how</em> Oracle is being used. We’ve
found many clients are merely using Oracle as a data store and use few, if
any, stored procedures or functions. This is underutilizing the power of the
database but has the advantage of simplifying migrations.</p>

<p>The software audit is a critical portion of the overall audit. Many
applications using sophisticated ORMs may find they need few, if any, changes
when switching from Oracle to PostgreSQL. However, other
applications—particularly those building SQL directly—will need a deeper audit
to understand how the migration is to be accomplished.</p>

<p>Further, because the migration process is time-consuming, make sure you’re
only migrating what needs to be migrated. Do you have historical data that
doesn’t need migration? Do you have tables or stored procedures which are no
longer used? You may find it simpler to skip those.</p>

<h2><a name="2-planning"></a>2. Planning</h2>

<p>With the primary audit finished, it’s time to develop a detailed plan on
migrating to PostgreSQL. We know of one company in Portland, Oregon, which
managed to get 90% of their software tests on a large application passing in a
single evening. More typical, however, is the case where the “Oracle-only”
assumption runs deep. This is where PostgreSQL shines, because its SQL is
mostly compatible with Oracle’s.</p>

<p>The planning for most common use cases involves the schema migration, data
migration, and software migration. If you have a small schema (and this is
almost always a case where PostgreSQL is preferable to Oracle), the schema
migration can be done by hand. However, there are many open source and
commercial tools which can migrate an Oracle schema to a PostgreSQL schema.
Care will still need to be taken, however, especially if you have Unicode
data.</p>

<h2><a name="3-migration"></a>3. Migration</h2>

<p>The actual migration at the database level will take some time, but it in the
software level that you’ll particularly experience grief. Having a robust test
is imperative, as is a strong QA department.</p>

<p>One issue we routinely encounter is Unicode.  Unicode is problematic for
Oracle because it was developed in an ASCII world while PostgreSQL fully
understands and supports Unicode. For example, in Oracle, depending on the
value of <code>NLS_LENGTH_SEMANTICS</code>, you may find that <code>VARCHAR2(10)</code> holds 10
characters or 10 bytes. If it’s bytes, you cannot store <code>日本</code>, because that’s
actually twelve bytes! In PostgreSQL, <code>VARCHAR(10)</code> is guaranteed to hold 10
<em>characters</em>, not <em>bytes</em>, so <code>日本</code> is just fine. (Note: you can also use
<code>NVARCHAR2</code> in Oracle to enforce character semantics, but <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/TTSQL/types.htm#TTSQL136" target="_blank"><code>NVARCHAR2</code> assumes a maximum of two-bytes per character</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, so you still
can’t store <code>日本</code> in an <code>NVARCHAR2(10)</code> field).</p>

<p>Another common pitfall is that Oracle often treats the empty string as <code>NULL</code>.
This is in violation of the ANSI-SQL standard and causes no end of headaches
for developers. For example, in Oracle you can often find cases of outer joins
with ambiguous semantics because you don’t know if field you’re asking for was
missing (not joined), or is the empty string.</p>

<p>Or one surprising issues we’ve stumbled across: Oracle allows you to declare
integers (<code>INT</code>), but internally it’s a <code>NUMBER(38,0)</code> and conversion tools
generally have <code>NUMERIC(38,0)</code> in the PostgreSQL version of the schema.  While
<a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/206406" target="_blank">there are those who
insist there’s no performance difference between the two</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, when ported to
PostgreSQL, you should use the appropriate integer datatypes and not their
<code>NUMBER(p,0)</code> equivalents. We’ve found significant performance improvements by
converting <code>NUMERIC(p,0)</code> types to appropriate integer types.</p>

<p>There are many other subtle differences (<code>TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE</code>, join
differences, transactions, function incompatibilities, and so on). The free,
open source <a href="https://github.com/orafce/orafce" target="_blank">Orafce</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> tool module will make
much of the pain go away, but not all (and it may prove to be a crutch you
shouldn’t rely on). Again, comprehensive automated testing backed by a QA
department is helpful here.</p>

<h2><a name="4-testing"></a>4. Testing</h2>

<p>While it’s improved dramatically over the past decade or two, testing is the
bane of many IT companies. Developers tend to test that their software does
what they want it to do, while strong QA teams try to test that their software
doesn’t do what they don’t want it to do. The difference is subtle, but it’s
the difference between creation and destruction.</p>

<p>A key example comes from your issue and bug tracking systems. If you find that
certain bugs are recurrent, this is often the case of a developer fixing the
general issue for a specific case. A strong QA department should recognize the
general nature of the problem and extend their tests to cover the general
issue, not the specific one.</p>

<p>While this problem is not specific to an Oracle to PostgreSQL conversion, it
<em>is</em> an issue which can mean the difference between a successful and
unsuccessful migration. You will need to be sure that your testing approach is
solid and that you’re not just testing that everything works with valid
inputs, but that they fail in an expected way with invalid inputs.</p>

<p>But be aware that testing isn’t just about whether or not your software works
as expected. Can you restore from a backup? How long does it take for you to
failover? What’s your throughput like? Do you have “stealth” applications
which assume Oracle and you’ve just switched? Perfectly functioning software
doesn’t matter when your infrastructure catches fire.</p>

<p>And please keep in mind that this testing isn’t just a “one off” for the
migration. A solid testing plan allows you to ensure that regressions don’t
occur in the PostgreSQL implementation as it undergoes further development.
Spending this time and money up front will save you time and money later.</p>

<h2><a name="5-adjusting"></a>5. Adjusting</h2>

<p>The migration and testing aspects of your transition will likely need to be
repeated more than once. There’s not much to say about the “adjustment” phase
other than:</p>

<ul>
<li>You must have measurable success criteria</li>
<li>Those criteria should be automated as far as is possible</li>
<li>Rejected work must document the success criteria and how to achieve them</li>
</ul>

<p>However, keep in mind that you must not let the perfect be the enemy of the
good. Are you excelling in some areas and under performing in others? Is this
an acceptable trade off? Are all success criteria <em>really</em> that important?
Remember: your primary goal is to facilitate the Oracle to PostgreSQL
migration.  You can take full advantage of PostgreSQL’s power later.</p>

<h2><a name="6-deployment"></a>6. Deployment</h2>

<p>Congratulations! Your migration and testing have worked. You’ve successfully
met your success criteria. You’ve made adjustments here and there, but you’re
ready to roll things out. At this point, it’s very hard to give specific
advice because the details of the your deployment will vary widely from
company to company.</p>

<p>This deployment should follow your standard patterns as much as possible to
avoid confusion, but it needs to be planned carefully, with care taken to
minimize downtime as much as possible (especially if your database-backed
applications are public facing). However, because this deployment will likely
be more significant than most, it does need to be set up in such a way that
when obstacles are encountered that cannot be easily overcome, you can
immediately abandon the deployment.</p>

<p>If you’re not using it yet, something like a <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html" target="_blank">blue-green

is recommended here. Changing <em>live</em> systems is hard and it’s easy to paint
yourself into a corner. Instead, build a duplicate of the system on production
(containers work brilliantly here, of course), and run your tests against your
changes. When you’re satisfied that all is well, point everything over to the
new system, being ready to switch it back in a hurry, if needed.</p>

<p>And if you do this on a Friday, you deserve the pain you’re going to
inevitably going to face.</p>

<h2><a name="7-rollback"></a>7. Rollback</h2>

<p>If you’ve followed the steps above and gotten to the point of rollout, you’re
probably in a good place but you still need to plan for rollback. Will you
need it? Probably not. But if you haven’t planned for it and you need it, it’s
like having a fire without fire insurance. Discovering a critical production
problem a week after deployment could involve losing a lot of data. </p>

<p>There are a few things to note about the rollback plan.</p>

<ul>
<li>It must be thoroughly documented</li>
<li>It must be thoroughly tested</li>
<li>It is developed in concert with the migration and deployment plans</li>
<li>You must decide if data loss is acceptable or if data migration is part of
the plan</li>
</ul>

<p>The last point is very tricky. If you have something catastrophic happen, you
may want to accept data loss rather than risk having to rollback your rollback
because you couldn’t migrate new data to the old system. If a rollback is
necessary, it’s like to be spotted right away and not a week later, so you’re
unlikely to face this decision, but prepare for it.</p>

<p>Remember that a key flaw of release management is that people tend to expect
success, not prepare for failure. By expecting success but planning for
failure, you’ll put yourself in a great position.</p>

<h1><a name="success"></a>Success!</h1>

<p>Congratulations! You’ve successfully replaced Oracle with PostgreSQL. You’ve
saved yourself a lot of money, you have a database that’s easier to manage,
and you get to take advantage of many of the powerful features of PostgreSQL.</p>

	    <div>In other words, statements such as <code>CREATE</code>,
<code>ALTER</code>, <code>DROP</code>, and others which alter the _structure_
of the database cannot be rolled back, thus potentially leaving your database
in a corrupted state if a transaction fails.  Oracle Database version 11g
Release 2 has a workaround via the cumbersome 'Edition-Based Redefinition' to
work around this limitation.</div>
