<h2><a name="whats-a-project-manager"></a>What's a Project Manager?</h2>

<P><a href="https://www.pmi.org/about/learn-about-pmi/what-is-project-management" target="_blank">The Project Management Institute defines project management as follows</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<blockquote>Project management...is the application of knowledge, skills,
tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project
requirements.</blockquote>

<p>As a proponent of agile (in particular, <a href="/wildagile.html">WildAgile</a>), I find that project management is an oft-ignored area in
the field. For example, Scrum defines three roles, the product owner,
the team, and the ScrumMaster.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> No mention of any sort of management, project or
otherwise, is made. It's not that Scrum is against management; it's that Scrum
is a framework for getting stuff done and management is an outside force.</p>

<p>So there you are, a brand new project manager (PM), or product owner (PO) and ...
wait a minute. What the heck's the difference? In many agile projects, there
is no project manager and the PM's responsibility is distributed across the
various members of the team: product owner, developers, ScrumMaster (Scrum),
Coach (XP), and so on. Thus, the definition of a PM is sometimes muddied and
in my experience, varies wildly across organizations.</p>

<p>Curiously, when I find companies have the PO role, that&lsquo;s more clear.
The product owner represents the "voice of the customer" and maintains the
product backlog of tasks that the team works on. The Product Owner, in
addition to representing the customer, also represents project stakeholders,
so they have two masters, so to speak: the customers and management. But their
role is the mama bird role of constantly vomiting up new tasks to feed to the
baby birds of the team; they're not really project managers.</p>

<p>But because the waters are often muddied here, I&lsquo;m going to handwave
this entire issue and hope you don&lsquo;t notice. Instead, we&lsquo;ll focus
on an age-old problem in the PM/PO space: what should we do next?</p>

<p>So ...</p>

<h2><a name="what-should-we-do-next"></a>What Should We Do Next?</h2>

<p>As a fledgling team lead, PO, PM, or whatever title your company&lsquo;s
uses for <em>person responsible for getting stuff done</em>, figuring out
what to work on next is a daunting task. It involves having an in-depth
knowledge of the project, the product, the business, and the team. And when
you're juggling 27 things at once, it can be maddening to have a baby bird
cheeping "what do I do next?", and demanding a meal.</p>

<p>You might think that <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/backlog-grooming/" target="_blank">backlog grooming/refinement</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> is all you need, but that still doesn't tell
you, out of the 374 tasks that need to be done, which should be done
<em>next</em>. Fortunately, there's a very simple way to do this, and that's
to build a business case for each task, using just three numbers.</p>

<h2><a name="the-three-number-business-case"></a>The Three Number Business Case</h2>

<p>A business case is really nothing more than making an argument that a thing
should or should not be done, but using numbers to back it up. If you want to
learn more, I have a "rescuing a legacy codebase" talk that covers this.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-2"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

    <figcaption>The Three Number Problem </figcaption>
    </div>
</figure>


<p>But what numbers do we use? For this case, try to pick the three most
important numbers that represent value in your tasks.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-3"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> At one point, when I had the project
management role in developing <a href="https://taustation.space/" target="_blank">Tau
Station</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, a free-to-play (F2P) narrative sci-fi adventure, the complexity
of the role was overwhelming, but each task's "three most important numbers"
were clear: complexity, usability, monetization.</p>

<p>The <strong>complexity</strong> of a task is simply how many "story points"
(or whatever you call them) that team members have assigned to a task. I
recommend using <a href="http://www.velocitycounts.com/2013/05/why-do-high-performing-scrum-teams-tend-to-use-story-point-estimation/" target="_blank">Fibonacci numbers for story point estimates</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, especially for what I'm
about to show you.</p>

<p>The <strong>usability</strong> of a task was how useful it was to the
customers. Again, you want to use Fibonacci numbers here. You need a
<em>feel</em> for what this number is because, in reality, you cannot get a
perfect estimate. However, it's clear that a feature which lets customers
download reports is more valuable to them than a feature which slightly
adjusts the color of a sidebar, so the former might get the number "13" while
the latter might get the number "1".</p>

<p>In the case of Tau Station, everyone is allowed to play the game for free,
but as with many F2P games, there are <strong>monetization</strong> options in
the game<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-4"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> and anything which increases the likelihood of monetization gets a
higher number.  A "Happy Hour" feature, where the players get extra rewards
when they buy stuff gets a higher monetization number than a feature to
make forum posts "sticky." Again, you're using Fibonacci numbers here.</p>

<p><em><strong>Important:</strong> the three things you choose should reflect
<em>your</em> business concerns and may very well be vastly different business
requirements. You may choose "security" or "legal compliance" or something
else entirely. Tau Station included these as part of the "usability" number.
Think hard about these numbers because you don't want to get them
wrong.</em></p>

<p>Once you have your three numbers, what next? Well, you need to assign
weights to them. This will largely be a process of trial and error until it
feels right. In our case, let's say that both monetization and complexity get
a weight of 40 and usability gets a 20.  Then you play around with formulae
until you get a final score, with higher-scoring tasks having a greater
priority. Here's the formula I used for Tau Station, though you will need to
adjust this for your own needs:</p>

<pre><code>pros  = monetization * 40 + usability * 20
cons  = complexity * 40
scale = 10
score = ( ( pros – cons ) + 500 ) / scale</code></pre>

<p>Let's say a task has a monetization of 1, and a usability of 5, and a
complexity of 7. How does that compare with a take of a monetization of 3, a
usability of 3, but a complexity of 13? The first task might earn us less
money and be less useful, but it's easy to implement. Decisions, decisions
...</p>

<p>Well, monetization and usability are both "pros" (benefits), and complexity
is a "con" (drawback), so we have task 1:</p>

<pre><code>pros  = 1 * 40 + 5 * 20
cons  = 7 * 40
scale = 10
score = ( ( 140 – 280 ) + 500 ) / 10</code></pre>

<p>And task 2:</p>

<pre><code>pros  = 3 * 40 + 3 * 40
cons  = 13 * 40
scale = 10
score = ( ( 240 – 520 ) + 500 ) / 10</code></pre>

<P>Task 1 has a final score of 36, while task 2 has a final score of 22. Thus,
we do task 1 first.</p>

<p>Once you learn to plug those three numbers into a spreadsheet, you can then
sort the tasks by score and prioritize tasks at the top of the list.</p>

<figure class="image">
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="/static/images/three-number-spreadsheet.png" width="600" alt="A spreadsheet showing different tasks and how they are scored and sorted to show priority.">
    <figcaption>A Spreadsheet Showing Our Three Number Business Case </figcaption>
    </div>
</figure>


<h2><a name="real-world-usage"></a>Real World Usage</h2>

<p>When I was doing this, I found it made my work much easier and the team
appreciated it because it gave a clear direction. Plus, since the team provides
the complexity estimates, they know that they have a real impact on project
direction, something that teams usually appreciate.</p>

<p>I used an Excel spreadsheet, but also a small program that I wrote which
fetched data from github and <a href="https://www.zenhub.com/" target="_blank">ZenHub</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> to automate the creation of my spreadsheet. Every month I'd repeat
the process, fill in missing numbers, sort the rows and share it with the team
via a Google Doc. It worked very well and figuring out the project tasks for the
month was no longer a stressful affair..</p>

<p>Note that sometimes you will find tasks which don't seem to be scored
correctly with this technique. When that happens, investigate whether or not
your three numbers seem reasonable. Maybe your weights are wrong, or your
formula is off.</p>

<p>Or, as sometimes happens, there are external factors. A task may be
complex, offer low usability, and no monetization potential, but another team
is demanding that XML feed <em>now</em> and hey, you have to play nice with
others. When odd events like that happen, use your judgement instead of the
spreadsheet.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, this technique, like all others, isn't perfect. When
used correctly, however, it's a great tool for building value and focusing on
your real needs. Further, you prioritize greater value and, when asked to
justify your decisions, you have <em>numbers</em> to back them up. Even if
they're not perfect, quibbling over numbers and formulae instead of hunches is
a much safer career move.</p>

	    <div>I&lsquo;ve read, but I
cannot prove, that the <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org">Scrum
Alliance</a> used to offer Certified Scrum Master (two words) courses where
you became a "Scrum Master" after a two-day course and a multiple choice quiz.
After many people objected, correctly, that you can&lsquo;t become a "master"
after only two days, the Scrum Alliance shortened it to ScrumMaster, thus
"solving" the problem.</div>
