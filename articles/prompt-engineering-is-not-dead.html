<h1><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>

<p>If you search for the phrase, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?t=h_&amp;q=prompt+engineering+is+dead&amp;ia=web" target="_blank">prompt engineering is
dead</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, you’ll
find plenty of articles opining on the topic. But what is prompt engineering,
really? While there are jobs with the “prompt engineer” title, in reality, it’s
a skill you develop. You wouldn’t call yourself a “PowerPoint Engineer,” would
you?</p>

<p>Prompt engineering is nothing more than telling the AI how it should respond.
There are <a href="https://medium.com/@yassine.aqejjaj/mastering-chatgpt-prompt-engineering-the-9-frameworks-you-need-to-know-607ae5af9931" target="_blank">plenty of prompt engineering “frameworks”
available</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
each with its own strengths and weaknesses. I even created my own that I named
CARESS.</p>

<p>But much of prompt engineering seems to be going away. When using many
foundation models, you often no longer have to tell it its role, such as,
“You’re a brilliant logician at a top university.” That distracts it. It used to
be that for complex problems, you wanted to add “let’s think step by step,” but
today’s foundation models often recognize that this is necessary and
automatically do that for you. It seems that USING ALL CAPS TEXT to emphasize
important bits still has an impact, but I can’t prove it.</p>

<p>One bit of prompt engineering that is still critical is explaining the audience.
“explain like I’m five,” or “explain like I know nothing about biostratigraphic
paleontology”<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog js-only" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span><noscript><a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-1-return" aria-label="Footnote 1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></noscript> are often huge wins for
understanding complex information.</p>

<p>But reality shows thoughtful prompting remains crucial for unlocking AI’s full
potential and I hit one example of this today.</p>

<h1><a name="the-perl-parsing-challenge"></a>The Perl Parsing Challenge</h1>

<p>Over on perlmonks.org, a site that sadly reminds us of the age of Perl, <a href="https://perlmonks.com/?node_id=11162904" target="_blank">someone
asked about an interesting problem involving
s-expressions</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. Specifically, how to
parse them into Perl data structures.</p>

<p>Perl is <em>literally</em> designed to excel at problems like this. Further, I’ve found
that Perl has a weird advantage when using generative AI to write Perl. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0yKLumIbaM&amp;ab_channel=InternetofBugs" target="_blank">Carl
Brown of the internet of bugs explains
it</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. In
short, newer languages with few examples on the Web are hard for AI. Established
languages with plenty of breaking changes between versions are also hard for AI.
Perl has neither of these issues. The Perl community’s obsession with
backwards-compatibility is one of the reasons why companies can safely use
modern versions of Perl with little-to-no disruption in their working code base.</p>

<p>So I took that problem with Perlmonks and dumped it into Claude, ChatGPT, and
Gemini, confident that with a touch of tweaking, one or more of them would spit
out the right answer. Here was my prompt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’d like a small Perl script which can parse this string:</p>

<pre><code>
(ignore (
    (0 ((0 k320w)
        (1 wireless))
    )
    (1 ((0 k330w)
        (1 wireless))
    )
    (2 acer)
    )
)

(config(
    (61 '61 key.kbd')
    (78 '78 key.kbd')
    (mouse mouse.kbd)
    (pad pad.kbd)
)
)</code></pre>
  
  <p>And turn it into a data structure like this:</p>

<pre><code>
'ignore' => [
            [
             'k320w',
             'wireless'
            ],
            [
            'k330w',
            'wireless'
            ],
            [
            'acer'
            ]
],
'config' => {
             '61' => '61 key.kbd',
             '78' => '78 key.kbd',
             'mouse' => 'mouse.kbd',
             'pad' => 'pad.kbd'
              },

</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>All of them failed <em>miserably</em> at this task. No amount of prompting got me where
I wanted to go. To be fair, it was a minimalist prompt, <a href="/articles/building-an-iphone-app-with-chatgpt.html#my-first-prompt">nothing like I’d use
for serious
programming</a>,
but the foundation models have gotten good enough that I’m used to them working
just fine with small prompts for small problems.</p>

<p>Then I remembered ChatGPT’s o1-preview. This model is a <em>reasoner</em> in OpenAI’s
lingo. OpenAI has defined the following five steps in its path to AGI:</p>

<ol>
<li>Chatbots (done!)</li>
<li>Reasoners (chatbots who think)</li>
<li>Agents (they can plan and take independent action)</li>
<li>Innovators (capable of scientific discoveries)</li>
<li>Organizations (they can run an entire company)</li>
</ol>

<p>The o1-preview is, in Sam Altman’s terms, “the ChatGPT 2.0 of reasoners.” In
other words, it’s very, very limited, but it’s just the start. If you give it an
open-ended problem with a subjective answer, it frequently underperforms against
most foundation models. However, if you give it a problem with a clearly defined
solution, it’s amazing, such as when Kyle Kabaseres watched o1-preview spend an
hour replicating code that it took him a year to write for his PhD thesis.</p>

<div class="video-responsive">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M9YOO7N5jF8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>So I threw the prompt at o1-preview and it got it right <em>the first time</em>.</p>

<p>Well, almost. Note that in the example above, the top-level keys are <code>ignore</code>
and <code>config</code>. o1-preview assumed those keys. I asked it to not assume those keys
and to instead make a more generic parser. It did:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">$VAR1 = {
    'ignore' =&gt; {
        'ARRAY(0x1578af278)' =&gt; [
            '1',
            [
              'k330w',
              'wireless'
            ]
        ]
    },
    'config' =&gt; {
        'ARRAY(0x15789cff0)' =&gt; [
            '78',
            '78 key.kbd'
        ]
    }
};
</code></pre></div>

<p>No amount of prompting seemed to fix <em>that</em>, either.</p>

<p>So I sat back, read through the code the various models produced and thought
about this. That’s when I had an “ah ha!” moment.</p>

<h1><a name="the-power-of-domain-knowledge-in-prompting"></a>The Power of Domain Knowledge in Prompting</h1>

<p>Each of the models was using a character parser. This is an old parsing
strategy, very common in C, when you read one character, looked at the <em>next</em>
character, and figured out what to do. This is a rather fragile way of parsing
text and, to my everlasting shame, <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/DOUGW/AI-Prolog-0.741/source/lib/AI/Prolog/Parser.pm" target="_blank">is the approach I took in writing a Prolog
interpreter in
Perl</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>In fact, almost every time I see a complex, hand-written parsing problem in
Perl, people who aren’t using regular expressions are using character parsers.
They’re so prevalent in Perl and many other languages that this is what AIs are
trained on.</p>

<p>Instead, one of the more modern approaches is to use a lexer to convert the
data into a series of labeled tokens and then use a grammar to transform those
tokens into the desired output. In this case, because the output was very
specific, I felt that lexing the data and writing our own procedural code to
handle the resulting tokens would be a better fit. But how to prompt o1-preview
to do this?</p>

<p>As it turns out, back in 2006, in the <a href="https://www.perl.com/pub/2006/01/05/parsing.html/" target="_blank"><em>very first article</em> I had ever written
about Perl</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, that’s exactly
what I was doing. o1-preview doesn’t allow uploading files, but I was able to
paste in my first prompt, and then tell it to use the approach outlined in the
article, which I then pasted in. The result?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can’t use string (“acer”) as an ARRAY ref while “strict refs” in use at
  parse.pl line 103.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I pasted in that error, with no other commentary, <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/674dadc2-0970-8009-a24f-8019723e573b" target="_blank">and the code ran just
fine</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>Is the code perfect? Nope. There are definitely a few things I’d want to tweak,
including the token definitions:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">my $lexer = string_lexer($input,
    [ 'LPAREN',        qr/\(/ ],
    [ 'RPAREN',        qr/\)/ ],
    [ 'QUOTED_STRING', qr/'[^']*'|&quot;[^&quot;]*&quot;/ ],
    [ 'IDENTIFIER',    qr/[^()\s]+/ ],
    [ 'WHITESPACE',    qr/\s+/, sub {} ],  # Skip whitespace
);
</code></pre></div>

<p>But I’m still pretty happy with the outcome.</p>

<h1><a name="looking-forward"></a>Looking Forward</h1>

<p>So far, we’ve found that using AI is more beneficial for those who are less
skilled. However, those who are less skilled probably would not have solved
this particular problem. Effective prompt engineering isn’t just about clear
commands. Sometimes it involves sharing domain expertise and guiding the AI on
alternative approaches that requires your expert knowledge.</p>

<p>As models advance, prompt engineering is getting much easier, but it remains
valuable. For now, we’re seeing the focus shift from “let’s think step-by-step”
workarounds to knowledge sharing and problem framing. Human expertise continues
to be crucial for getting the full potential out of AI.</p>

<p>Your jobs are safe for another day.</p>
