<h1><a name="the-first-corinna-commits"></a>The first Corinna commits</h1>

<p>Recently, <a href="https://github.com/Perl/perl5/commit/8cf9e0b7ee" target="_blank">some of the first commits of the new Corinna object
system</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> for Perl have been
merged into the Perl core. If you’re not familiar with it, <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/blob/master/pod/perlclasstut.pod" target="_blank">I wrote a brief
tutorial</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>Around the same time as those commits were merged, I was rummaging around on an
old computer and discovered, to my shock, that I had an <em>old</em> implementation of
what I was trying to do, before that fateful day at a conference when Sawyer X,
the man driving Perl development, <a href="/blog/politics-in-programming.html">saw my work, liked it, but urged me to to
stop the implementation and just design something
great</a>. (As an aside, it also doesn’t quite
appear to match my previous descriptions of it. Oops).</p>

<p>With my initial commit of that code on September 2, 2018, the Corinna project
has been roughly four and a half years from conception to the initial core
implementation.  Since that time, I worked on design, made an initial
announcement, and led a design team of some of the top experts in Perl, with
much feedback coming from others who’ve designed object systems such as Moose or
Moo, and from that effort, Corinna was accepted and the Perl core will have
clean, mature OOP system for the first time (and one whose prototype,
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Object::Pad" target="_blank">Object::Pad</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> has been running in
production at more than one company).</p>

<p>Keep in mind that <code>bless</code> and <code>@ISA</code> will still be there. We’re not taking
anything away because the Perl 5 Porters (a.k.a., P5P) strive hard to not break
backwards-compatibility.</p>

<p>If you’re curious, here’s what a simple 2D point class looked like;</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">class Point {
    has [qw/x y/] =&gt; ( default =&gt; sub { 0 } );

    sub clear ($self) {
        $self-&gt;@{ 'x', 'y' } = ( 0, 0 );
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>That’s not good at all, but I was trying to work <em>within</em> Perl’s limitations. It
was also largely a response to improve upon
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Moxie" target="_blank">Moxie</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">package Point {
    use Moxie;

    extends 'Moxie::Object';

    has x =&gt; ( default =&gt; sub { 0 } );
    has y =&gt; ( default =&gt; sub { 0 } );

    sub x : ro;
    sub y : ro;

    sub clear ($self) {
        $self-&gt;@{ 'x', 'y' } = (0, 0);
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>I quite liked the intent of some of the ideas in Moxie, but that syntax is what
pushed me to finally build Corinna. By contrast, here’s the same code in
Corinna:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">class Point {
    field ( $x, $y ) :param = 0;

    method clear () {
        ( $x, $y ) = ( 0, 0 );
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>There will be an adjustment period while people learn a new way to program in
Corinna, the same way that learning a new programming requires learning to think
a different way, but overall, the Perl community is very happy about the
project. Some are not, but that’s OK. Having a perfectly homogeneous community,
marching in lockstep, no questions asked, would be a creepy thing. It would also
be a useless thing. Diversity of opinion is not only healthy, but needed.</p>

<h1><a name="whats-next"></a>What’s Next?</h1>

<p>That’s a great question. I’ve co-written one book on Perl and written another
(linked in the images at the top of the page), <a href="/blog/resigning-from-the-perl-foundation.html">I served two decades at The Perl
Foundation</a>, the last several
years as a member of the board, I have <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/OVID" target="_blank">a bunch of modules on the
CPAN</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, and our company, <a href="https://allaroundtheworld.fr" target="_blank">All Around the
World</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, is still doing well, with multiple
contracts. I’m currently having fun building an
<a href="https://www.openapis.org/" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> system using
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2" target="_blank">Dancer2</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> (something I’ve not had much chance
to play with before), and another company inquired about help from us to go in
and fix their object-oriented mess, including cleaning up a bunch of old code to
use <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose" target="_blank">Moose</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>So we’re doing fine, but whither Perl? Or to abuse Shakespeare:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code>To Perl or not to Perl, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the code to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous criticism,
Or to add commits against a sea of troubles,
And by rebasing, end them? To die(), to sleep(),
No more; and by a sleep() to say we end
The heartache and the thousand natural shocks
That Perl is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To die(), to sleep();
To sleep–perchance to dream–ay, there's the 'no strict.'
</code></pre></div>

<p>Sue me. I like poetry. Why do you think my nickname is “Ovid”?</p>

<p>Let’s be honest, Perl isn’t as popular as it used to be. There’s a lot of angst
in the Perl community expressed over this. There’s also a lot of
finger-pointing. There are many reasons that Perl is not as popular as it once
was, but rather than ruminate on history and stir up debates over things we
cannot change, I want to look to the future.</p>

<p>Fix the problem, not the blame.</p>

<p>So what’s the problem?</p>

<p>Sure, we can talk about fewer Perl developers or fewer companies starting new
projects in Perl, but those are <em>symptoms</em>. Instead, I want to focus on <em>one</em>
problem that Perl has and I think it’s both important and solvable.</p>

<p>Perl 5 was released in October of 1994 and there’s a misconception that Perl
hasn’t changed much since then. I still remember a Linux conference in
Prague where a programmer was telling me that Perl hasn’t been updated in
decades and this is a widespread misconception that hurts Perl (we suck at
marketing).</p>

<p>Just looking at the stable releases in the last decades:</p>

<p>As you can see, Perl gets a regular, major release every year. Some of the new
features introduced into Perl include native <code>try/catch</code> blocks.  Function
signatures are now on by default. Unicode 14.0 is supported. True booleans are
supported. Some older misfeatures, such as indirect object syntax and
<code>multidimensional</code> are disabled (they’re still available, but if you don’t know
what they are, don’t worry). There are some amazing improvements to the regular
expression engine, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Compatible_Regular_Expressions" target="_blank">widely considered the best in the programming
world</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>There’s much more, but many issues are very Perl-specific and even many Perl
programmers are not aware of the work done by the porters.  The Perl 5.36.0
release alone represents approximately a year of development since Perl 5.34.0
and contains approximately 250,000 lines of changes across 2,000 files from 82
authors (taken from the <code>perldelta</code> file for 5.36.0).</p>

<p>Note that 82 developers might seem like a lot, but it’s also incomplete. Many
people who’ve contributed haven’t done so by committing directly to the Perl
repository.</p>

<p>So Perl is still under heavy development, but it’s hard to argue that we’ve done
a great job communicating that, so how can we communicate that?</p>

<h1><a name="perl-7"></a>Perl 7</h1>

<p>The excellent <a href="https://www.raku.org/" target="_blank">Raku Programming Language</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> was known as
“Perl 6” for many years, but it diverged far enough from its Perl roots to merit
a separate name. So when there was much excitement about a new release of Perl
called Perl 7, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/perl-will-finally-make-the-jump-from-perl-5-to-7/" target="_blank">there was great news coverage of
it</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>In short, even with a fresh Perl install, to use Perl effectively today, you
often get the behavior of an older version of Perl and you have to ask for the
modern features. If you’re new to Perl, there’s good chance you wouldn’t know
that.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that work was halted amidst disagreements over direction and the
<a href="https://blogs.perl.org/users/psc/2022/05/what-happened-to-perl-7.html" target="_blank">Perl Steering Council (PSC) later released a discussion of about what it would
take to get to Perl
7</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. Is
Corinna going to be part of Perl 7? <a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2022/07/msg264336.html" target="_blank">The PSC recently announced that it
might</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
I think it should, but asking my opinion is like asking a parent if their
newborn is cute, so you can ignore me.</p>

<p>But on the off chance you don’t want to ignore me (you’re reading this, right?),
Perl 7 will likely be a newsworthy release, showing the world that Perl is still
in active development, but the features in the language are rather marginal in
value, in the eyes of many. Corinna is the single-largest change to the Perl
language in three decades, and that might make a splash, but again, I’m biased.
Nonetheless, releasing Perl 7 is not
trivial and Corinna might not be the top priority of the developers who will
actually get the work done. I can live with that.</p>

<p>At the risk of offending a few people, barring Corinna, any release of Perl 7 is
likely to be much of what we have in Perl right now, but with easier defaults.
It will simply make it easier to write Perl, but not offer much “new” to current
developers, beyond a message to the programming world.</p>

<p>For technical and political reasons,<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> Perl 7 without
Corinna might be exactly what Perl needs. But even then, Perl 7 will be a far
cry from the Perl released back in 1994. Perl’s been evolving rapidly over the
years, but without people hearing about it.</p>

<p>But how can we push this further? That’s what I’ve been thinking about.</p>

<h1><a name="perl-8"></a>Perl 8</h1>

<p>Perl’s regular expression engine is world-class, but it’s hardly the reason to
choose a language. Or to keep it. What else does Perl offer? With Corinna, Perl
will have one of the nicest OOP systems of popular dynamic languages (er, I may
be biased, but when I look at other “popular” dynamic languages, I wince). So
that can be two killer features. But we need more, but to get to “more,” we need
to address the fact that the Perl core is missing a few features that other
languages provide. We need to fix that.</p>

<h2><a name="installation-manager"></a>Installation Manager</h2>

<p>Recently, I hit an issue with a client. My code was correct, but failed in the
test environment due to a “Can’t locate object method” error. As it turns out,
the actively maintained CPAN module I was using was last updated in 2022, but
the version the client had was released over two decades ago! Worse, my attempt
to locally debug this was frustrated by some particulars in the client setup
which caused me to find a current local version of the module and not the
archaic version the client had. Fortunately, it was a trivial fix, but spending
time debugging this issue cost our client money they should not have had to
spend.</p>

<p>Per the <a href="https://nodejs.org/fr/blog/uncategorized/development-environment/" target="_blank">nodejs
blog</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CPAN and RubyGems have blurred the lines between development tools and system
  package managers. With <code>npm</code> we wish to draw a clear line: it is not a system
  package manager. It is not for installing firefox or ffmpeg or OpenSSL; it is
  for rapidly downloading, building, and setting up Node packages. <code>npm</code> is a
  development tool. When a program written in Node becomes sufficiently mature it
  should be distributed as a tarball, <code>.deb</code>, <code>.rpm</code>, or other package system. It
  should not be distributed to end users with <code>npm</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Out of the box, Perl has a <code>cpan</code> client which lets you install Perl modules.
It’s great for developing libraries, but we don’t offer great support for
developing <em>applications</em>. When I <code>cd</code> into a client directory, I want to run
something like <code>perl-local .</code> and have it pick up the version of Perl for <em>this
project</em> and use <em>this project’s CPAN modules</em>. Having this completely isolated
from other Perl projects which might have different needs. We have many Perl
tools designed to solve various parts of the problem, but it’s time to put them
into the core. <a href="https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2023/03/msg265923.html" target="_blank">There’s now a discussion on the P5P mailing list about
addressing
this</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>To put this as a simplistic user story:</p>

<ol>
<li>As a developer</li>
<li>I want to easily set up multiple isolated Perl environments</li>
<li>So I can support multiple isolated clients/projects</li>
<li>Because my work shouldn’t have the fragility of picking up the wrong
dependencies</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s a lot of work there, but a developer installing Perl for the first time
should be able to solve this, just as developers downloading other languages for
the first time can.</p>

<h2><a name="concurrency"></a>Concurrency</h2>

<p>&lt;snark&gt;Promises, promises.&lt;/snark&gt;</p>

<p>Much of the programming world today is dealing with concurrency in some form.
There are serious problems this solves, including:</p>

<ol>
<li>CPU-intensive work can be split across multiple CPUs (or GPUs!).</li>
<li>Don’t wait on code that might block due to external resource constraints.</li>
</ol>

<p>P5P has long preferred that new ideas for Perl be tested on the CPAN before
incorporating these ideas into the core. This allows us to see what is and isn’t
working (or in some cases, just to better understand the syntax people prefer).
There are multiple attempts to solve the concurrency issue on the CPAN and given
that this feature is being used more and more, and becoming a default feature in
many languages, I think the core needs to support his.</p>

<h2><a name="data-constraints"></a>Data Constraints</h2>

<p>As with an installation manager and concurrency, the CPAN offers many solutions
for constraining your data. You might notice I avoided the word “type.” Computer
scientists have reasonable disagreements about types and type systems. Computer
programmers have shouting matches.</p>

<p>I know what I want from types. Others strongly disagree. However, a very
workable compromise has emerged in Perl. This is largely based on
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Type::Tiny" target="_blank"><code>Type::Tiny</code></a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and similar modules. For
Moose, for example, I can define an attribute like this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">has expires_at =&gt; (
    is  =&gt; 'rw',
    isa =&gt; InstanceOf ['DateTime' ],
);
</code></pre></div>

<p>With that, I can read and write the <code>expires_at</code> value and know that the value
<em>must</em> be a <code>DateTime</code> instance or a subclass (er, or anything that overloaded
the <code>isa</code> method to lie and say it’s a <code>DateTime</code> class, but we’ll ignore that
because it opens up a fascinating discussion well beyond the scope of this
post).</p>

<p>For a subroutine, I might do this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">sub reset_totals ($count, $totals) {
    state $check = compile(Int, HashRef[Int]);
    ($count, $totals) = $check-&gt;($count, $totals);

    $count = constrain($count);

    foreach my $key (keys $totals-&gt;%*) {
        $totals-&gt;{$key} = $count;
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Unlike the attribute approach, the <code>sub</code> solution only guarantees the kind of
data you have in variables at the time of the <code>$check-&gt;()</code>. In the above
subroutine, if <code>constrain</code> returned an array reference instead of an integer,
the above code would not only continue to run, but it would do so without
warning, to the point of corrupting the data in the code calling this function!</p>

<p>Note that the above is not a hypothetical problem. It happens, but we kid
ourselves that our test suite will protect us. In reality, attaching a data
constraint to variables instead of statements would fix the above. TypeScript
isn’t perfect, but I’ve enjoyed the fact that many of these errors simply don’t
occur (though TypeScript handles this differently).</p>

<p>We are not, however, there yet. <code>Type::Tiny</code> and related tools are great ways of
minimizing the issue, but their syntax is clumsy and their features are limited,
largely because they’re working within the limitations of Perl. This is not a
criticism of these modules, though. We have to start somewhere. However, <a href="https://allaroundtheworld.fr" target="_blank">our
company</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> is finding more and more clients relying
on <code>Type::Tiny</code> due to the safety it provides. More work is needed here.</p>

<h2><a name="miscellaneous"></a>Miscellaneous</h2>

<p>I think Perl needs native exceptions. It needs native stack traces. Native
constants, including deep structures. Copy-on-write would be useful, but it’s
not clear how feasible this is. There’s a lot more, but what I’ve written might
already be controversial enough that stopping is probably good.</p>

<h1><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1>

<p>We need a vision of Perl’s future. Many of the things we need in the Perl core
are things we’ve re-implemented many times on the CPAN. Not having them in core
means developers have to learn their current environment’s way of handling this,
and makes it easier to choose a module that might be inappropriate, or worse,
unmaintained. This increases the cognitive burden on all developers who, I’m
sure, are more interested in building solutions than arguing over them.</p>

<p>Perl 7 is going to be wonderful, but it’s time to start thinking about Perl 8.</p>
