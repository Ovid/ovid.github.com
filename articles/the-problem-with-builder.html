<hr></p>

<p>I’ve been spending a lot of time designing <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki" target="_blank">a new OO syntax for the Perl
language</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> called Corinna. This syntax is not
designed to be another object-oriented module. Instead, it’s designed to be a
be a core part of the language. It’s received a lot of support (and a few
detractors), but I have a problem with it.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve been worried about the slot variable <code>:builder</code> attribute and I’ve
been concerned that it’s problematic. I’ve nattered on about this on IRC and
just generally let the concerns simmer in my mind. If we’re going to get to
propose something for the core, it’s better that we avoid mistakes before that
time rather than after. Then Damian Conway shared some thoughts with me about
his concerns for <code>:builder</code> and that was the final straw. Something has to
change.</p>

<hr />

<h1><a name="history"></a>History</h1>

<p>As part of our proposal, we have this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">class SomeClass {
    has $x :builder;
    method _build_x () {
        return rand;
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you call <code>SomeClass-&gt;new</code>, you’ll get a random numeric value assigned to
the <code>$x</code> slot variable. Note that <code>$x</code> has no reader or writer, so it’s
designed to be completely encapsulated. But it’s not and that’s a problem.</p>

<p>That’s been bugging me for quite a while, but to explain that, I need to
go back in time.</p>

<p>In 1967 (my birth year, but I swear it’s a coincidence), the first truly
class-based OO language was released, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula" target="_blank">Simula
67</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and it introduced classes,
polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance (and coroutines (!), but let’s not
go there).</p>

<p>Classes, polymorphism, and encapsulation are relatively uncontroversial, but
the debate over inheritance has raged for decades.</p>

<p><a href="http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en" target="_blank">Alan Kay, the man who invented the term “Object Oriented” in Utah “sometime
after
1966”</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
and who’s been doing OO programming before most of us were born, has made it
clear over the years that inheritance in OO is very problematic. He’s even
left it out of the implementation of some OO languages he’s created. And then
I found a Quora question entitled “What does Alan Kay think about inheritance
in object-oriented programming?” and <a href="https://qr.ae/pNQ2Kd" target="_blank">someone purporting to be Alan Kay
responded</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> with a deeply thoughtful answer. His first
paragraph is fantastic (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Simula I didn’t have inheritance (paper ca 1966) and Simula 67 did (paper ca
  1968 or so). I initially liked the idea — it could be useful — but soon
  realized that something that would be “mathematically binding” was really
  needed because the mechanism itself let too many semantically different things
  to be “done” (aka “kluged”) by the programmer. For example, <strong>there is no
  restriction of any kind to have a subclass resemble a superclass, be a
  refinement of a superclass, etc. All relies on the cleanliness of mind of
  programmers (and even the most clean of these often just do things they need
  when in the throes of debugging).</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if I create a class named <code>Vehicle::Motorized</code>, there is
nothing to stop your <code>Order::Customer</code> class from inheriting from it. Would
that make sense? Probably not. But there we are.</p>

<p>Next, let’s take a look at a Python object:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-python">class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def inverse(self):
        return Point(self.y,self.x)

point = Point(7,3.2).inverse()
print(point.x)
point.x = &quot;foo&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p>And for those who would like to see that in our current proposal:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-python">class Point {
    has ($x,$y) :reader :writer :new;

    method inverse {
        return $class-&gt;new( x =&gt; $y, y =&gt; $x );
    }
}
my $point = Point-&gt;new( x =&gt; y =&gt; 3.2 )-&gt;inverse;
say $point-&gt;x;
$point-&gt;x(&quot;foo&quot;);
</code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see, we’ve assigned “foo” to the x value of a Point object.  We’ve
done this in both Python and our new OO syntax for Perl. Sadly, due to the
need to harmonize types across the language, we can’t have type constraints in
v0.1.0. This is a serious limitation, but we’re taking baby steps.</p>

<p>But what about the Python version? Surely they must validate their data,
right? No. Pythonistas have assured me that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/91q2op/trying_to_understand_pythonic_classes/" target="_blank">validating your data is very
unpythonic</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>(I envision spit-takes from tons of Moo/se fans out there right now).</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html" target="_blank">Python 3.7 contains data
classes</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and those will
help, but  I don’t know how widespread the usage is.</p>

<hr />

<h1><a name="variables-and-types"></a>Variables and Types</h1>

<p>But what does that have to do with inheritance?</p>

<p>For many languages, you can try something like (example in the Go programming
language) <code>var myvar float64 = "foo"</code> and it will throw an exception. It might
be compile-time. It might be runtime. But it will die a horrible death because
the variable, <code>myvar</code>, has a type associated with it and if you assign
something that doesn’t match that type (or that the language can’t/won’t
coerce), then things go boom.</p>

<p>Why is that? Because on line 372 of your <em>whopping huge function</em>, it’s easy
to have something like <code>myvar := stuff[0:2]</code> and not be sure what kind of data
<code>stuff[0:2]</code> contains.</p>

<p>So we can say that—for a small subset of types the programming language can
understand—variables in those kinds of languages are the “experts” about what
they can do and if you try to put that variable in an invalid state, it blows
up.</p>

<p>That’s great. But what about <code>var celsius float64 = -1300.15</code>. Is that valid?</p>

<p>Absolute zero is -273.15 on the Celsius scale, so we can make a reasonable
argument that the above is not valid. In languages like
<a href="https://raku.org/" target="_blank">Raku</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, we easily fix that:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">subset Celsius of Num where  * &gt;= -273.15;
my Celsius $temp = -1300.15;
</code></pre></div>

<p>The above will fail at compile-time. Most languages that allow types, however,
aren’t quite as flexible, but you can use classes instead.</p>

<h1><a name="classes-are-types"></a>Classes are Types</h1>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">my $temp = Celsius-&gt;new( temperature =&gt; -1300.15 );
</code></pre></div>

<p>Assuming your class is sane, the above should throw an exception because
you’re trying to create an object with an invalid state.</p>

<p>If you think that’s similar to how built-in types work, it is. We can think of
a class as a user-defined type. Types have a set of allowed values and
operators you can apply to those values. Classes have (often complex) sets of
allowed values and methods (operators) you can apply to those values.</p>

<p>Just as an <code>int</code> is often an expert in values -32,768 to 32,767, or
-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 if you’re using 4 bytes (larger values for
more bytes, of course), so is your <code>Celsius</code> class an expert about allowed
Celsius temperatures. And your <a href="/articles/alan-kay-and-oo-programming.html">Personal
Shopper</a> knows exactly how much
money it can spend, and even if it knows you have enough money to buy cocaine,
it’s still going to throw an exception if you request that because it’s an
illegal operation.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<h1><a name="the-problem-with-builder"></a>The Problem with :builder</h1>

<p>And this gets us to <code>:builder</code>. In Perl‘s Moo/se family of OO, you can do
something similar to this (but using our new syntax):</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">class Parent {
    has $x :builder;
    method _build_x () {
        return rand;
    }
}

class Child isa Parent {
    method _build_x () { return &quot;not a number&quot; }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>This has exactly the same issue with see with Python’s <code>point.x = "foo"</code>. It’s
hardly necessary to belabor the point, but I will: <code>$x</code> is supposed to be
private, but we’ve grossly violated encapsulation.</p>

<p>Ah, you reply. But Moo/se has types. So let’s look at Moo/se, using a better
example (not great, but enough to get the point across):</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">package Collection {
    use Moose;

    # this is a personal module which gives me a &quot;saner&quot; Perl
    # environment
    use Less::Boilerplate;
    use Types::Standard qw(Int ArrayRef);
    has _index =&gt; (
        is      =&gt; 'rw',
        isa     =&gt; Int-&gt;where('$_ &gt;= 0'),
        builder =&gt; '_build__index',
    );

    # default, but maybe someone wants a different default
    sub _build__index { 0 }

    has items =&gt; (
        is       =&gt; 'ro',
        isa      =&gt; ArrayRef,
        required =&gt; 1,
    );

    sub BUILD ( $self, @ ) {
        my @items = $self-&gt;items-&gt;@*;
        my $type = ref $items[0];
        foreach my $item (@items) {
            if ( not defined $item ) {
                croak(&quot;items() does not allow undefined values&quot;);
            }
            if ( ref $item ne $type ) {
                croak(&quot;All items in collection must be of the same type&quot;);
            }
        }
    }

    sub num_items ($self) {
        return scalar $self-&gt;items-&gt;@*;
    }

    sub next ($self) {
        my $i = $self-&gt;_index;
        return if $i &gt;= $self-&gt;num_items;
        $self-&gt;_index( $i + 1 );
        return $self-&gt;items-&gt;[$i];
    }

    sub reset ($self) {
        $self-&gt;_index(0);
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>It goes without saying that writing an iterator like the above can be rather
problematic for a number of reasons, and yes, the <code>_build__index</code> method is
kind of silly, but it shows the issue. For example, what would a negative
index do? In the above, it would throw an exception because of the
<code>Int-&gt;where( '$_ &gt;= 0' )</code> constraint. But what would happen if we set the
index to a value larger than the size of the <code>items</code> array reference (and
ignoring that the above allows <code>$coll-&gt;_index($integer)</code>).</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">package My::Collection {
    use Moose;
    extends 'Collection';

    sub _build__index { 5 }
}

my $collection = My::Collection-&gt;new( items =&gt; [qw/foo bar baz/] );

while ( defined( my $item = $collection-&gt;next ) ) {
    say $item;
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>What do you think the above does? The constraint passes, but it prints
nothing. That’s because the allowed value of the index is tightly coupled to
something else in that class, the number of items in the collection.</p>

<p>Oh, but Ovid, I wouldn’t write something like that!</p>

<p>Yes, you would. I do it too. We all do it when we’re quickly hacking on that
883 line class from our 1,000 KLOC codebase and we’re rushing to beat our
sprint deadline. Programmers do this <em>all the time</em> because we have a language
which allows this, but OO modules which encourage this. You can inspect tons
of OO modules and find attributes (a.k.a “slot variables” in our new system)
which are coupled with other values. We like to minimize that, but sometimes
we can’t and classes are supposed to <em>encapsulate</em> this problem and handle it
internally.</p>

<p>My suggestion is that, if you want to allow this internally, you have to do it
manually with <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki/Cookbook#construct--adjust-and-destruct-buildargs-and-build" target="_blank">the <code>ADJUST</code>
phaser</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">class Collection {
    has $index;
    has $items :new;

    ADJUST (%args) {
        # other checks here

        $index = $self-&gt;_default_index;
        if ( $index &gt; $items-&gt;@* - 1 ) {
            # don't let subclasses break our code
            croak(...);
        }
    }

    method _default_index () { 0 }

    # other methods here
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Do I recommend that? No. Can you do it? Yes. And it has some advantages.</p>

<p>First, you are being explicit about <em>which</em> slots are can access in your
subclasses. Second, you have fine-grained control over slot initialization
ordering.</p>

<p>By default, with Corinna, slots are initialized in the order declared (until
you hit <code>:new</code>, in which case all <code>:new</code> slots are initialized at once). In
Moo/se it’s harder to predict the order of initialization. That’s why you
often see a bunch of attributes declared as <code>lazy</code> to ensure that non-lazy
attributes are set first. If you have circular lazy dependencies, it can be
hard to work out and you fall back to <code>BUILD</code> or <code>BUILDARGS</code> as needed.</p>

<p>Yes, this does mean a touch more work on the off chance you need to override a
slot in a subclass. I’ve been writing Moo/se for years and I can count on the
fingers of one hand the number of times I’ve needed to do this. However, I
can’t count how many times I’ve unnecesssarily littered my namespace with <code>sub
_build...</code> methods because this is largely what Moo/se prefers and what
developers will call you out on in code reviews if you do it some other way.</p>

<p>Oh, and we also hit issues like this. Which of these is correct?</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">class Position {
    slot $x :name(ordinate) :builder;

    # and many lines later...

    method _build_ordinate { return rand }   # Does the builder follow the public slot name?
}

class Position {
    slot $x :name(ordinate) :builder;

    # and many lines later...

    method _build_x { return rand }          # Or does it follow the private slot variable name?
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we were to allow builders, we should, at least, mandate the syntax
<code>:builder($method_name)</code> and not allow default builder names.</p>

<h1><a name="builder-guidelines"></a>Builder Guidelines</h1>

<p>So here are a few guidelines we should follow for assigning default values to slots.</p>

<ul>
<li>Every slot <em>should</em> have a default value.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is often a code smell to have an undefined slot.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the = default syntax</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example below, <code>:new</code> says we can pass the value to the constructor,
but if we don’t, it will get the value 42.</p>

<p><code>has $x :new = 42;</code></p>

<ul>
<li>YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It).</li>
</ul>

<p>Don’t allow overriding a private slot value unless you have a clear need for
it. This also prevents littering the namespace with a <code>_build_...</code>  methods.</p>

<ul>
<li>Liskov is your friend</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle" target="_blank">Liskov Substitution
Principle</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>: if
you have a subclass and it <em>must</em> be allowed to override some of this data,
remember that a subclass should be a more specialized version of a parent
class and must be usable anywhere the parent can be.</p>

<ul>
<li>Check for coupling</li>
</ul>

<p>If the slot data is tightly coupled to some other slot data, consider breaking
the coupling or ask yourself if delegation is more appropriate. Have checks in
<code>BUILD</code> (Moo/se) or <code>ADJUST</code> (Corinna) to verify the integrity of your class.</p>

<p>If all of the above seems like too much to remember, just don’t allow child
classes to set parent slot data. Corinna should follow one of the early
principles guiding its design: you should be <em>allowed</em> to do bad things, but
the language design shouldn’t <em>encourage</em> bad things.</p>
