<h1><a name="the-proposal"></a>The Proposal</h1>

<p>There has been some discussion of whether or not the new Perl OO model,
<a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor" target="_blank">Corinna</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, should support exposing <code>field</code>
variables to subclasses:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">class Parent {
    field $name :inheritable;
}

class Child :isa(Parent) {
    field $name :inherited;
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>There are a few benefits cited there.</p>

<ol>
<li>If <code>field $name</code> doesn’t exist in the parent, the child class throws a
compile-time error.</li>
<li>If the child can access <code>$name</code> directly, it’s a performance win (no method
call).</li>
<li>By being explicit about <code>:inheritable</code> and <code>:inherited</code>, we’re not exposing
data by accident.</li>
</ol>

<p>It seems like a win, but it’s not.</p>

<h1><a name="a-little-background"></a>A Little Background</h1>

<p>Most OO developers today use class-based OO, but JavaScript is popular enough
that prototype-based OO is getting better known. Then there’s Dr. Alan Kay, <a href="/articles/alan-kay-and-oo-programming.html">the
man who coined the term “object-oriented
programming”</a> five decades ago and
is considered one of the fathers of the concept. For him, OOP is actually about:</p>

<ul>
<li>Message passing</li>
<li>Isolation</li>
<li>Extreme late binding of everything</li>
</ul>

<p>So that’s another way of looking at OOP. And by “isolation”, Kay actually said
“local retention and protection and hiding of state-process.” He would <em>not</em>
approve of exposing <code>field</code> variables because it’s explicitly exposing the
state, not hiding it.</p>

<p><figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/opinion.gif" width="600" alt="An image from the movie, 'The Big Leboski'">
    <figcaption>Yeah, well, you know, that’s just like your opinion, man. </figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>So clearly there are different ideas about how OOP should be <em>implemented</em>, but
Kay is focusing on how to do it <em>safely</em>. He has a maths and biology background
and he thought about the billions of cells in our body which die every day, but
we don’t. He wants that sort of robustness in object-oriented code. To him, the
only truly successful demonstration of OOP is the internet. Tons of servers
crash every day, but the internet does not.</p>

<p>In fact, before he got to this conception of OOP, his original description of
OOP left out inheritance because it was so problematic. The way I like to
describe it is the <code>Person :isa(Invoice)</code> problem. Even if you can get that to
work, it simply doesn’t make <em>sense</em> and until AI becomes a hell of a lot
better, the software has no way of knowing if what you’re doing makes sense.</p>

<h1><a name="what-is-inheritance"></a>What is Inheritance?</h1>

<p>Per Wikipedia,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)" target="_blank">inheritance</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an
  object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class
  (class-based inheritance), retaining similar implementation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some languages, such as Perl, allow multiple inheritance (Corinna does not).
Other languages, such as Java and Ruby, only allow single inheritance, but
provide you with tools (interfaces and mixins, respectively) as a substitute. In
fact, inheritance is widely viewed as so problematic that Go and some Visual
Basic variants don’t provide inheritance at all!</p>

<p>What’s worse, I’ve found that many developers kind of assume that behavioral
inheritance and subtype inheritance are the same thing, but they’re not.
Behavioral inheritance (which is what Perl tends to use), merely uses syntax to
say “hey, I’m borrowing my parent class’s behavior.” There are no guarantees.
Subtype inheritance, however, ... wait? What’s a subtype?</p>

<p>In <a href="https://raku.org/" target="_blank">the Raku language</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, here are two subtypes of <code>Int</code>:
<code>Odd</code> and <code>Even</code>:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">subset Even of Int where * %% 2;
subset Odd  of Int where !(* %% 2);

my Odd $x = 4;  # we get an exception here
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can use the <code>Even</code> and <code>Odd</code> subtypes <em>anywhere</em> you can use an <code>Int</code> and
your program is still guaranteed to be correct, but with the added safety of
knowing that those variables will <em>always</em> be even or odd if they’re set.</p>

<p>Here’s an <strong>important concept</strong> to remember (you’ll be tested on it later!): the
parent type does not know, or care, about what subtypes will be created from it.
You can subtype anything in Raku (or other OO languages) and while subtypes know
about their parents, the reverse is not true.</p>

<p>So subtype inheritance, used by languages such as Eiffel or Beta, guarantees
that you can use an instance of a subclass anywhere you can use an instance of
a parent class and the program still works.</p>

<p>Of course, that’s what <a href="https://blog.knoldus.com/what-is-liskov-substitution-principle-lsp-with-real-world-examples/" target="_blank">the Liskov Substitution
Principle</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
is all about.</p>

<p>If you’re subclassing, you probably want to enforce subtype subclasses, but
neither current Perl OO (nor Corinna, to be fair), can do that easily (when/if
we get types/type constraints in Perl, it will help).</p>

<p>So that gives you an idea about divergent views on inheritance and was probably
boring as heck. So forget about that for now and let’s move on to an example.</p>

<h1><a name="a-bank-account-example"></a>A Bank Account Example</h1>

<p>You need to create a simple, in-memory <code>Bank::Account</code> class. Obviously, this is
a toy example, but bear with me.</p>

<ul>
<li>You instantiate it with a customer name</li>
<li>Initial balance is zero</li>
<li>You can withdraw money, but throw an exception if the balance would go below zero</li>
<li>You can deposit unlimited amounts of money</li>
</ul>

<p>Because Corinna, does not (yet) support type constraints, we’ll ignore them for
now.</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">class Bank::Account {

    # Of *course* this is too simplistic. The first pedant
    # who points this out loses 500 internet points.

    use My::Exceptions qw(InsufficientFunds)
    field $customer :param :reader;
    field $balance  :reader {0};

    method deposit ($amount) {
        $balance += $amount;
    }

    method withdraw ($amount) {
        if ( ( $balance - $amount ) &lt; 0 ) {
            InsufficientFunds-&gt;throw(&quot;Naughty, naughty&quot;);
        }
        $balance -= $amount;
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>OK, so far, so good. The code works fine and everyone is pleased. Later,
business requirements are updated because Mr. Moneybags has tons of money, but
sometimes he wants to be overdrawn a bit. Since Mr. Moneybags is an important
customer, you need to create a <code>Bank::Account::Premium</code> class to allow premium
customers to be overdrawn.</p>

<p>You’re a good programmer, you know you shouldn’t rewrite code, so you just want
to subclass it:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">class Bank::Account::Premium :isa(Bank::Account) {
    sub withdraw($amount) {
        ...
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>But what goes in the <code>withdraw</code> method? You properly encapsulated your first
class, so now you can’t get around that. In your <code>Bank::Account</code> class, you make
a tiny change:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">field $balance :inheritable :reader {0};
</code></pre></div>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">class Bank::Account::Premium :isa(Bank::Account) {
    field $balance :inherited;
    sub withdraw($amount) {
        $balance -= $amount;
    }
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>And now, everything works fine and you move your code into production.</p>

<p>You them immediately move it back out of production because production is
throwing exceptions left and right. Why? Your system knows that if <code>$instance
isa Bank::Account</code> holds true, the balance can never be less than zero and
because the code knows it can trust your <code>Bank::Account</code> class, it’s safe.</p>

<p><code>Bank::Account::Premium</code> is a <em>behavioral</em> subclass, not a <em>subtype</em> subclass
because the behavior of the child differs from that of the parent. It allows
negative balances and the parent does not.</p>

<p>Oh, but maybe that <em>doesn’t</em> happen. I’m just being paranoid, right? Or maybe it
only happens in one place and you can write <em>one tiny little hack</em> rather than
remove this valuable functionality.</p>

<p>Months pass and your code is running fine and you’ve moved on to another
department, when you get a frantic call to find out why everything is failing.
After investigation, you discover the bug. Someone’s released a module allowing
<code>:isa</code> type constraints and the person maintaining the <code>Bank::Account</code> module
has realized that it’s safer to constrain the <code>$balance</code>:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">field $balance :inheritable :reader :isa(ZeroOrPositiveNum) {0};
</code></pre></div>

<p>But your code which <em>does</em> allow negative balances blows up because it’s
inherited this field.</p>

<p>Remember: the <strong>parent classes don’t know how they’re going to be subclassed</strong>
and they shouldn’t care. Instead, they should do everything in their power to be
as correct as possible and the <code>:isa(ZeroOrPositiveNum)</code> constraint is
perfectly appropriate.</p>

<p>By exposing our internal state to our subclass, we’ve tightly coupled them
because the cheap <code>:inheritable</code> workaround <em>seems so easy</em>. But again, Kay
reminds us of “local retention and protection and hiding of state-process.”
State and process are tightly coupled inside of a class and exposing state
without the process that guarantees the state is correct leads to fragile code.</p>

<p>Here’s the real issue: ignoring encapsulation because it’s “easy” means we don’t
have to think about our object design. Instead, we should have had something
like this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">class Bank::Account :abstract {
    field $customer :param :reader;
    field $balance  :reader {0};

    method deposit ($amount) {
        $balance += $amount;
    }

    method withdraw ($amount) {
        $balance -= $amount;
    }
}

class Bank::Account::Regular :isa(Bank::Account) {
    use My::Exceptions qw(InsufficientFunds)

    method withdraw ($amount) {
        if ( ( $self-&gt;balance - $amount ) &lt; 0 ) {
            InsufficientFunds-&gt;throw(&quot;Naughty, naughty&quot;);
        }
        $self-&gt;next::method($amount);
    }
}

class Bank::Account::Premium :isa(Bank::Account) {
    # no need to override any behavior, but we could
    # provide more behavior as needed
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>Seems like more work up front, but we have known for a long time that fixing
broken code in the design stage is far cheaper than fixing it after it’s in
production. But we’re so used to violating encapsulation, often without even
realizing it, that we fall back on this rather than using proper design.</p>

<p>Yes, this example is contrived, but it’s based on my decades of OO programming.
I also started off as a rubbish OO developer, having learned the syntax and not
the theory. My punishment was spending years working with multiple clients,
cleaning up the messes of other developers with the same background.</p>

<h1><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Encapsulation has been accepted best practice for OOP developers for decades.
For <em>Perl</em> developers, it’s a contentious issue, due in part to how easy it is
to apply “quick fixes” without having to revisit our design. And then, everyone
quotes Larry. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/81807-perl-doesn-t-have-an-infatuation-with-enforced-privacy-it-would" target="_blank">Larry Wall famously
said</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perl doesn’t have an infatuation with enforced privacy. It would prefer that
  you stayed out of its living room because you weren’t invited, not because it
  has a shotgun.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That might work for disciplined developers who understand OOP. But we’re often
undisciplined. We often don’t understand OOP. We’re often under time pressure
and it’s easy to make mistakes then.</p>

<p>Larry has done great things with Perl, but this saying has outlived its
usefulness.  For small, quick hacks, or proofs-of-concept, that’s fine. But as
systems grow, it’s not fine. There’s a saying that wise men make saying so fools
can repeat them. I have long been one of those fools, but years of fixing broken
OOP systems in many shops have taught me that I was wrong.</p>

<p>Corinna likely <em>will</em> allow encapsulation violation via a cumbersome meta-object
protocol (MOP), but this will glaringly stand out like a sore thumb as a code
smell. It will be clear that there’s a design flaw and the design should be
revisited.</p>

<p>Not being able to easily violate encapsulation seems like a burden, but only
because we’ve grown lazy and have skipped thinking about design. In reality, it
will help us build more robust systems and <em>teach</em> us when our design is flawed.
Far from being a limitation, encapsulation will be a powerful tool.</p>
