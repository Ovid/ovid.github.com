<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I’m the lead designer of the <a href="https://github.com/Ovid/Cor" target="_blank">Corinna object-oriented system
going into the Perl core</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. I’m probably a bit
biased here.</p>

<hr />

<p>It seems like a week can’t go by without another blog entry or video
explaining <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=why+is+object+oriented+programming+bad" target="_blank">why object-oriented programming (OOP) is
bad</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
While the content of many of those articles is bad, if you read enough of
them, some common themes emerge: “mutability” and “genericity.” Both are
difficult to solve, so it’s worth explaining what’s wrong here. But first,
what’s an object?</p>

<h1><a name="whats-an-object"></a>What’s an Object?</h1>

<p>Let’s take an extended quote from my book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Perl-Curtis-Poe/dp/1118013840/" target="_blank">Beginning
Perl</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>ÆVAR THE PERSONAL SHOPPER</h2>
  
  <p>You’re an awfully busy person and have little free time but plenty of
  disposable income, so you’ve decided to hire a personal shopper. His name is
  Ævar (any resemblance to reviewers of this book, living or dead, is purely
  coincidental) and he’s friendly, flamboyant, and most of all, cheap.</p>
  
  <p>Because Ævar is new to both your city and the job, you have to tell him
  carefully how much money he can spend, exactly what quality of products you
  want, and where to buy them. You may even have to tell him which route to drive
  to pick up the goods and how to invoice you.</p>
  
  <p>That, in essence, is procedural code and that’s what you’ve been doing up to
  now. You’ve been carefully telling the computer every step of the way what to
  do.</p>
  
  <p>After a few months of explaining every little detail, Ævar gets upset and
  says, “þegiðu maður, ég veit alveg hvað ég er að gera” (Icelandic for “Shut up
  dude; I know what I’m doing”). And he does. He knows what you like and where to
  get it. He’s become an expert. In OO terms, you might now be doing this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-perl">my $aevar = Shopper::Personal->new({
    name   => 'Ævar',
    budget => 100
});
$aevar->buy(@list_of_things_to_buy);
my $invoice = $aevar->get_invoice;</code></pre>
  
  <p>You’re no longer telling Ævar every little step he needs to take to get your
  shopping done. He’s an expert, and he has all the knowledge needed to do your
  shopping for you and present you with the bill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s all objects are. They are experts about a problem domain, but that’s
actually a problem.</p>

<h1><a name="generic-experts"></a>Generic Experts</h1>

<p>This issue is extremely important, but it’s one that’s not touched on often
enough.</p>

<p>OOP works best in constrained environments. For a company, if your developers
really understand OOP (they often don’t), OOP is great because you can create
custom experts for your domain. Your objects know how your custom
authentication and authorization system work, so you can share this code with
other developers in the company and they don’t have to rewrite it.</p>

<p>Until that one team has some custom authorization rules dealing with SOX
compliance, GDPR, PCI, or a host of other things you’ve never heard of. They
might ask you to make your objects more “generic” to allow them to handle
their custom needs, but that starts to add complexity and, potentially bugs.
If enough teams ask for this, your beautiful authorization object can become
an unmaintainable god object. Systems grow. Needs grow. And software often
suffers as a result.</p>

<p>This is fundamentally a problem with <em>abstraction</em>. Just because I develop a
good abstraction for my use case doesn’t mean I’ve developed a good
abstraction for yours.</p>

<p>In other words, for <em>generic</em> OOP, it can often be problematic because your
solution may not be general enough to fit other people’s needs. For Perl, the
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/LWP" target="_blank">LWP</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> objects to handle Web communication tend
to work very well because it’s a well-constrained problem space.</p>

<p>In contrast, my own
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/HTML::TokeParser::Simple" target="_blank">HTML::TokeParser::Simple</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
module is less generally useful because it fits a particular use case that
doesn’t map well to many closely-related problem spaces, For example, when you
need to map out the hierarchical structure of HTML, the stream of tokens my
module produces aren’t well=suited to this. Thus, you may find yourself using
a class that kinda works for what you want, but is ill-suited for what you
need.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<p>Another interesting problem is dealing with scale. For example, in a small
company with maybe 20 to 30 programmers, a well-designed object can be a
godsend. In a company with 200 to 300 programmers, a well-designed object can
often be a source of pain because it doesn’t <em>quite</em> fit the needs of other
teams. However, it’s often hard to make an object extensible in a way that
fits the needs of others because it’s hard to plan for needs that you’re not
aware of. If you’re lucky, your company might have a policy that all shared
objects have a shared interface (possibly with default implementations) and
different teams implement them to suit their unique needs.</p>

<p>If you’re unlucky, different teams all implement their own <code>Customer</code> class
and if your code interacts with their code, there’s no guarantee of
interoperability. I speak from bitterly personal experience where another team
implemented a <code>User</code> object that had only the two methods they needed, not the
many, many more that were generally available. A search through their
multi-million line codebase revealed many custom-made user objects, none of
which really worked like the others, but any of which could potentially leak
into other’s code (this is where static typing or type constraints really
shine, but that’s another article).</p>

<p>Objects for poorly-defined problem spaces don’t scale. If you might face this,
define those problem spaces <em>before</em> the problem starts. Let people create
their own custom objects, but with the minimum required common functionality.</p>

<h1><a name="mutability"></a>Mutability</h1>

<p>The big issue that is touched on, however, is a serious problem: mutable
state. You can send an object to many different areas of your code and then
some code far away from you mutates the state and suddenly you find that the
<code>DateTime</code> object you were using has a different state from what you had
tested earlier.</p>

<p>As a general rule, sending an object somewhere is sending a reference, not a
copy. Why is this bad? <a href="https://rjbs.cloud/blog/2011/12/one-more-reason-to-dislike-mutability/" target="_blank">You can read Ricardo Signes' horror story about a bug
dealing with mutable state in
objects</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
When you’re building a complex system and you cannot depend on the state of
your objects, you are in for a world of hurt when it bites you because it can
be a nightmare figuring out what unexpectedly changed the state.</p>

<p>This is irrelevant in the face of immutable objects. Once you fully understand
why changing an object’s state is bad, your programming becomes much more
robust.</p>

<p>If you would like to know more about the issues with immutable objects, read
my <a href="/articles/using-immutable-datetime-objects-with-dbixclass.html">why do we want immutable objects?</a>
article.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As an aside, if you switch to a <a href="/articles/are-microservices-the-next-phase-of-object-oriented-programming.html">service-based
  architecture</a>,
  you can’t send references, only copies. This makes the system more robust, but
  the trade=off is performance. This is why cloning is often shallow instead of
  deep. <strong>But</strong>, if you have immutable objects, sending a reference is
  irrelevant because you don’t risk mutating its state. Well, unless you’re
  using an ORM and something outside the program mutates that state. Speaking
  of which ...</p>
</blockquote>

<h1><a name="object-relational-mappers"></a>Object-Relational Mappers</h1>

<p>But then we come to the real problem: Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs). ORMs
are almost by default mutable (there are immutable ORMs, but they’re not
common).</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">my $customer = Acme::Model::Data::Customer-&gt;new($id);
$customer-&gt;name($new_name);
$customer-&gt;save;
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is <em>real</em> fun when separate parts of the code fetch the same object from
the database and mutate it at the same time. <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/optimisticOfflineLock.html" target="_blank">Optimistic offline
locking</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
and similar strategies are your friend here.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you’re passing those around, it’s trivial for something to mutate the
state and cause you grief. For <a href="https://taustation.space/" target="_blank">Tau Station</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, we
(I) learned this the hard way and now we often fetch data from the database
and simply return a copy of the data structure. It’s faster and safer that
way.</p>

<p>But regardless of the safety of protecting the underlying data, it still
doesn’t alter the fact that not only is the state mutable, it’s stored
<em>outside</em> the program. You can be as careful as you want, even creating
read-only instances of ORM objects, but if two processes pick the same object
and something changes the underlying state, you can still have incorrectly
functioning software. ORMs make working with databases much easier, but there
is a price to pay.</p>

<h1><a name="teaching-oop"></a>Teaching OOP?</h1>

<p>Perhaps the biggest obstacle to effective OOP is, sadly, teaching it.</p>

<p>When I was learning Java in college, I still remember my first Java
instructor, fresh out of college, struggling to explain the different between
classes and instances. You could tell she knew the difference, but she had
trouble articulating it in a way that students could understand. But that’s
<em>class-based</em> OOP. Not all OOP systems are based around classes.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming" target="_blank">Prototype-based OOP</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
doesn’t have classes.</p>

<p>My second Java instructor had us build a Swing interface to read some records
from a database and display them in a form. I immediately thought
<a href="/articles/fixing-mvc-in-web-applications.html">MVC</a> and
built model, view, and controller classes, along with a complete set of JUnit
tests. My instructor rejected my code on the grounds of “I think this code
might be good, but I don’t understand it. Please submit all of it as a single
class.” I also had to not submit my JUnit tests.</p>

<p>Admittedly, my two Java instructors constitute an anecdote and not information
you can actually act on, but I’ve seen this again and again why people try to
explain what objects are.</p>

<ul>
<li>Objects are data with behavior attached</li>
<li>Objects are smart structs</li>
<li>Objects are user-defined data types</li>
<li>Objects are polymorphic containers</li>
<li>... and so on</li>
</ul>

<p>All of those miss the point. They’re talking about the implementation or
structural details of objects and not the <em>reason</em> for objects. Why do we have
cars? So we can drive from place to place. We can argue about the engines
later.</p>

<p>The reason we have objects, as I noted above, is that object can be experts
about a problem space. I can hand an object to a junior developer who knows
nothing about the underlying complexity and <em>that junior developer can use
that underlying complexity</em>. Pretty cool, huh?</p>

<p>Using objects is great, but building objects? Learning how to do this well
involves a bewildering array of concepts such as

and so on. The last point, I might add, is why I have objected to lvalue
attribute in Corinna (unless we can also have lvalue methods). You should be
able to freely convert this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">field $public_key :reader :writer;
</code></pre></div>

<p>To this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl">method public_key ($optional_key = undef) {
    # fetch key from keystore
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>And your interface remains unchanged on the <em>outside</em> of the class, allowing
you to keep your contractual promises with the class' consumers.</p>

<p>But many developers have asked for this:</p>

<div class="shadow"><pre class="scrolled"><code class="language-perl"> $object-&gt;public_key = $public_key;   # field
 # versus this:
 $object-&gt;public_key($public_key);    # method
</code></pre></div>

<p>For the above, we’ve tightly coupled the public interface to the private
implementation just to add a little syntactic sugar.</p>

  with seeing classes with names like <code>StartHtml</code> (which would build the start
  of an HTML document), that he mandated classes be named after <em>creatures</em>. He
  wound up with classes like the <code>AuthenticationFairy</code> and the <code>SessionGnome</code>,
  experts in their particular domains. Weird, but it appeared to work.</p>

<p>Since many OOP developers are self-taught, and with many OOP implementations
being hard to learn, and the bewildering array of complex and sometimes
contradictory “best practices” we have to learn, OOP seems to be a more
advanced concept than many developers realize.</p>

<h1><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1>

<p>I think there’s a good case to be made that OOP is not nearly as useful as
it’s claimed. I have worked with far too many clients whose OOP systems are,
quite frankly, broken. I’ve spent a considerable about of time and energy (and
thereby client money) fixing these broken systems. For one, someone had
created a system whereby every time you created a new system component, you
had to create a new class holding information about that component. No
specialized behavior—just information. In fact, for each component, sometimes
you had to add more than one new class—again, just for storing information
(almost all of it strings). I proposed a different, data-driven system which,
when done, would replace about 30 (and growing) classes with two (not
growing).</p>

<p>In contrast, great OOP systems are a joy to work on and have made my life
easier. I strongly recommend them, but they don’t seem terribly common.</p>

<p>In the research study <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Productivity+analysis+of+object-oriented+software+developed+in+a+commercial+environment%22" target="_blank">“Productivity Analysis of Object-Oriented Software
Developed in a Commercial
Environment”</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
(Potok, Vouk, Rindos, 1999), the researchers found that there is very little
quantitative evidence that OOP improves productivity in <em>commercial</em>
environments.  On the plus side, there was also little evidence that it
hinders productivity. And I know that when I hand a hideously complex
authorization object to a new developer, so long as they stick to the
interface, it magically <em>works</em>. I call that a win.</p>

<p>I love programming in OOP and (mostly) prefer it over procedural code (we’ll
skip other paradigms for now). Further, a great many programmers seem to reach
for it as a first solution rather than the last, so I’ll continue to work on
the Corinna OOP system to make OOP easier for Perl, but I’m hard-pressed to
combat criticisms against OOP itself. For now, just remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>Immutability is your friend</li>
<li>Keep your interfaces small</li>
<li>Well-constrained problem spaces are better for OOP</li>
<li>Poorly-constrained problem spaces can be great for OOP, but they don’t scale</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s a lot more than that, but those are great starters for decent OOP
programming.</p>

<p>Until next time, happy hacking!</p>
