<h1><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>

<p>For background, I’m an American and have lived in the US, Japan, the UK, the
Netherlands, France, and am currently writing this from Malta. I also spent
years researching and writing a “how to move to a foreign country” blog. I
considered writing a book on the topic, or touring the US and giving seminars,
but I’ve a wife, a daughter, a career, and a habit of moving from country to
country. I’m busy.</p>

<p>That being said, the situation in the United States is getting tense and people
are wondering if they can move to another country. They are asking about my now
defunct <a href="https://overseas-exile.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Overseas Exile</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> blog and others
have reached out to me directly. I’ll try to write more as I have time—though
I’m very busy right now—but let’s get into it. This will probably be my longest blog
entry to date, but it’s worth it. This is the information you need to know.</p>

<p>First, if you’re not a skilled worker, you might want to read my <a href="/blog/young-persons-guide-to-moving-abroad.html">Young Person’s
Guide to Moving Abroad</a>. If you
think you <em>are</em> a skilled worker, read on.</p>

<p>For many of you reading, you’re probably frustrated. You want to live and work
in a foreign country, but you’re not reading this to teach English in South
Korea or be a nanny in Brazil. You’re educated, highly skilled, and you think
you have skills that an employer overseas might value. In short, you want to
find someone who will sponsor your work permit. You’re sick of the rat race in
your home country and you long for a better life in Thailand where your nice
income will let you enjoy time on relaxing, pollution-free beaches.</p>

<p>The problem is that you don’t know where to start. There are some things you’ve
heard of, such as being a hot-shot CEO or working for a multinational and hoping
they’ll transfer you, but you don’t think that’s going to work for you.
This guide is a four-step program for getting a company abroad to offer you a
job. It’s what I used and others I know have successfully used this. I counseled
many people who tried to move abroad when my former blog was very popular.</p>

<ol>
<li>Laying the Foundation</li>
<li>Applying for Jobs</li>
<li>Handling the Phone Interview</li>
<li>Negotiating the Salary</li>
</ol>

<p>None of this is rocket science. None of this is quick and easy, either. It’s
also not guaranteed.  A variation of the described technique got me two job
offers in London (and would gotten me a third if I hadn’t already accepted a job
in Nottingham, UK) and a standing offer in Paris which I later accepted <em>after</em>
moving to the UK. It works, but you have to put in the effort.</p>

<p>But first, we need to take a little detour. You’ll want to read my article <a href="/blog/why-you-will-say-no-to-living-abroad.html">Why
You’ll Say “No” to Living
Abroad</a>, and then get your
papers in order.</p>

<h1><a name="get-your-papers-in-order"></a>Get Your Papers in Order</h1>

<p>My wife is French, I’m American and we got married at the Tower Bridge in
London. This involved the nightmare of trying to coordinate the paperwork of
three countries to make sure our marriage was legal. If you’re like me, you hate
paperwork but in the international arena, it becomes far more important than
many people suspect.</p>

<p>For example, in the United States they’ve tried to limit ID theft with vital
record cross-referencing. Since many identity thieves used to steal the identity
of someone already dead (hey, they’re not going to complain!), it was thought to
be a good idea to join death certificates with birth certificates so that a
re-issued birth certificate of a deceased person would, in fact, be marked
deceased. This works well if the deceased died in the state they were born, but
imagine what happens when a clerk in Montana gets a death certificate from a
clerk in Vermont. They don’t know each other, they don’t know each other’s
paperwork and the pain of accidentally marking a living person as dead is just
too great (I should know: my mother thought it hilarious when she received
paperwork telling her that her very alive husband wasn’t).</p>

<p>Now try to imagine the difficulty of different countries trying to verify each
other’s paperwork. It’s a nightmare of different languages, forms, legal
frameworks, etc. But you can have a running head start before it starts chasing
you.  Again, I remind you of the lesson of Count von Europe: if you had an
opportunity to leave tomorrow, would you really want to say “no thanks, I don’t
have all the paperwork.”</p>

<p>At a bare minimum, you need to have the following for everyone involved:</p>

<ul>
<li>Passports</li>
<li>Birth certificates</li>
<li>Marriage certificates</li>
<li>Death certificates</li>
</ul>

<p>You might need copies of university degrees or certifications if they’re
relevant to your new job.</p>

<p>If you have a rough strategy for getting out and you know where you are going,
you can plan ahead and research their requirements. You honestly don’t want to
be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/e8sn0/im_an_american_who_applied_for_dual_citizenship/" target="_blank">this poor
bloke</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
who found out that he had to have his ex-wife’s birth certificate before he
could claim dual Portuguese/US citizenship (read the rest of that guy’s story to
get an idea of how much “fun” international paperwork can
be).</p>

<p>You’re also going to have to learn what an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostille_Convention" target="_blank">apostille</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> is. An apostille
is akin to the stamp a notary public might issue but it’s recognized by the
countries which have signed on to the requisite Hague Convention. It really does
make your life simpler and it’s one case of international law making lives
easier.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, you want to have these documents on hand with apostilles
attached. However, this is not always appropriate. As my wife (then fiancée,
obviously) and I were trying to sort through the legal issues of three countries
recognizing our marriage, we found that for some documents, France would not
accept them unless they had been issued within the last six months. Some things
are going to be hard no matter what you do.</p>

<p>Now, let’s find you a job.</p>

<h1><a name="the-four-step-plan"></a>The Four-Step Plan</h1>

<h2><a name="1-laying-the-foundation"></a>1. Laying the Foundation</h2>

<p>You’re either a “skilled” or “unskilled” worker. The terms are vague, but
loosely involve the amount of training/education needed for a particular skill.
You may be the best pizza delivery guy in your country, but you’re still
going to be considered an “unskilled” worker. Unskilled workers are going to
have to go a different route to working overseas (such as teaching English),
but this post is going to concentrate on what skilled workers need for a
work permit job.</p>

<h3><a name="building-your-resumecv"></a>Building your Résumé/CV</h3>

<p>The first thing you have to do is to build your résumé. This is your key to
making things happen. Early in 2006, I dropped by a former employer in Portland
to pick up some paperwork I needed for my UK work permit. One of my former
colleagues asked: “why do you get to go to Europe and we don’t?”</p>

<p>I replied, quite honestly, “I know some of you are better programmers than I
am, but nobody knows who you are.”</p>

<p>In other words: I marketed myself. I constantly answered questions for people
online and posted advice for them on appropriate forums. I did this for years
and still do it on different forums.  You won’t necessarily have to do that (or
do that for years), but you do need to figure out some way of “marketing”
yourself so that you stand out. What this means is that you need to be
competent in your field but you don’t have to be the absolute best.  Here’s
where a multi-prong strategy helps. In addition to getting myself known online,
I also ...</p>

<ul>
<li>Volunteered with The Perl Foundation, a non-profit organization</li>
<li>Spoke at conferences</li>
<li>Wrote articles for web sites</li>
<li>Coauthored a book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Perl-Hacks-Programming-Debugging-Surviving/dp/0596526741/" target="_blank">Perl Hacks: Tips &amp; Tools for Programming, Debugging, and Surviving</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></li>
<li>Wrote a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Perl-Curtis-Poe/dp/1118013840/" target="_blank">Beginning Perl</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> book (er,
after I moved abroad)</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all on my CV. These sorts of things may not apply to you, but you
need to find something which will. For example, are you a social worker? How
many social workers in the US do you know who have joined the National
Association of Social Workers? Did you know that many magazines and Web sites
are struggling to find new writers? If you’re not sure who you would submit
article proposals to, grab a copy of <a href="https://writersmarket.com/" target="_blank">Writer’s
Market</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>Remember that the goal is to have a résumé which makes someone say “hey Inga,
take a look at this!” This means having something on there that other
applicants don’t.</p>

<p>Let me repeat that: have something on there that other applicants don’t. In
fact, have several somethings. I have an entire section entitled “Notable
Publications” and I have other accomplishments in another section. My résumé
gets noticed.</p>

<p>And try to make it relevant to your career. If you’re a jet mechanic,
volunteering at a homeless shelter is nice, but if you’re trying to get a job
as a volunteer coordinator, it’s a lot nicer. Anything which is both positive
and career-related should show up on that résumé, particularly if it’s
something other applicants won’t have (at the same time, a 37 page résumé is
going straight into the trash after everyone laughs at it).</p>

<h3><a name="generative-ai"></a>Generative AI</h3>

<p>If <a href="/tags/ai.html">generative AI</a> is relevant in your field, <strong>learn it</strong>. More
and more employers are seeking people with AI skills. <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ai-daily-brief-formerly-the-ai-breakdown/id1680633614" target="_blank">The Daily AI
Brief</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
is business focused and there are <em>tons</em> of free, online courses for learning
prompt engineering. <a href="https://courses.theneuron.ai/order?ct=3db06cdf-de64-48ea-9914-699d565f3396" target="_blank">The Neuron Daily has a decent
one</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
though it’s out of date (they’re always out of date), but it gives you place to
start.</p>

<h3><a name="google-thyself"></a>Google Thyself</h3>

<p>While you’re at it, hit the major search engines and search for your name. If
you search for my name, most of those links are me. If you search for my name
and “Perl”, the programming language I specialize in, almost all of those links
are me. That was me deliberately marketing myself. People will search for your
name. What will they find? If they find dishing out snotty, off-color remarks
and being rude to people, or find that photo of you vomiting at a frat party,
you’re not going to get the job. I know some people in my field who are
very competent and well-known, but because they’re rude online, they lose
employment opportunities. Even if you’re not going to spend a lot of time
online, take care of that online image. Every time you post something think
“would I want an employer to see this?”</p>

<h3><a name="get-your-friends-to-help"></a>Get Your Friends to Help</h3>

<p>While you’re at it, have your friends Google you — and read your résumé/CV — to
look for things that you’ll miss. You can’t afford to screw up here. A single
misspelled word may be quietly killing your dreams.</p>

<p>Also, throw a “go away” party with them. You’ll just sit around and get
stupidly drunk (or whatever it is that you do) and brainstorm ideas for things
you can get on your CV (failing that, ask Reddit!) Get those creative juices
flowing so you can figure out how to make this work.</p>

<p>Is this hard work? Yup. I never promised it would be easy, but it’s not going to
happen without effort on your part.</p>

<h2><a name="2-applying-for-jobs"></a>2. Applying for Jobs</h2>

<p>OK, you’ve started laying the foundations for getting a job in another country.
Now what? Find the damned country.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is develop a plan. It’s easier if you target just
one country as you can become more familiar with it. You need to be familiar
with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Shortage occupations</li>
<li>Work permit process</li>
<li>Local news</li>
<li>Employer advertisements</li>
</ul>

<p>Many countries have <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=country+shortage+lists" target="_blank">shortage occupation
lists</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, though the name
of the list often varies. These are jobs which the country doesn’t have enough
workers for and foreign workers (that’s you!) are more likely to get hired for
them. You’d be surprised at some of the jobs on them.  For example, the UK
shortage occupation list used to have social workers in child and family
services, but who would have thought that “social worker” is a high demand job?</p>

<p>Review these lists for the countries you’re interested in and ask yourself one
question: “could I get hired in this job in my home country?” If the answer is
“yes”, you’ve got a winner.  These are high-demand jobs in those countries and
they’re much easier to get work permits for. Because they’re shortage occupation
lists, employers are often more willing to be flexible.</p>

<p>Next, learn everything you can about the work permit process for that country.
Want to live in the UK? <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration" target="_blank">Start by reading everything on their official Visas and
Immigration
site</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. I
said “start”. You’re not going to finish there. You have to keep reading and
reading and reading. You have to know their work permit process backwards and
forwards.  You might think “but the employer is the one who has to know this,
right?” Sure, but trust me. All will be clear soon.</p>

<p>Next, you will start reading their local news religiously and getting to know
your target area. This includes scanning job adverts (but not applying yet). You
see, you need to know your target area very well. You need to know the markets.
You need to have a comfortable level of knowledge to discuss the place. This
will help for a couple of reasons. First, you’ll start to understand where the
jobs are. Second, when you get a phone interview, you might find “local”
discussions occurring and you want to sound knowledgeable. Sounding like you
have no idea where the hell you’re going is not going to impress anyone. At this
point, anything which might scare a potential employer off would be bad.</p>

<p>Let me rephrase this to make it absolutely clear what’s going on: you’re
trying to get a job in a foreign country. You have to prep for these job
interviews like you never have before in your life. Every question should be an
opportunity for you to hit a home run. You know the country. You know the
industry. You know the company, their competition, and anything else which may
be relevant. You are the most prepared person on the damned planet for that job.
Or at least, that’s what the employer needs to think.</p>

<p>Mind you, if you get an offer, you’ll find that you probably didn’t need all of
the knowledge you had, but you won’t know <em>which</em> bits you won’t need.
Don’t take chances here: learn everything.</p>

<h3><a name="other-employment-finding-strategies"></a>Other Employment Finding Strategies</h3>

<p>It’s worth noting that some countries don’t have shortage lists but you might
want to move there anyway. That’s OK. Just keep reading about their residency
and work permit requirements, along with their news. After a while, a picture of
the country’s economy will start forming and you’ll get ideas about where useful
skills might be needed. Or you might get lucky and discover a country like
Uruguay where all you need is a small, steady income and you’re good to go.
Remember: the key to this is to be flexible and think creatively.</p>

<p>You should also start hanging out on “expat” message boards for your target
country. Just type “COUNTRYNAME expat” into your favorite search engine and you
should find plenty of them. Don’t sign up at first, just start reading through
them. This will give you a sense of what other expats are doing, the problems
they face, and most importantly (for now) the type of work they found. Once you
have a feel for what the appropriate etiquette is for the boards you are
reading, sign up and join in the discussion if it’s appropriate. If the boards
welcome people looking to move there, you might find expats willing to offer
“inside” advice. Just like working on your résumé, you’re applying a multi-prong
strategy here.</p>

<p>Finally, just check this list of international job web sites. It’s not complete,
but it’s a good sample of jobs for you.</p>

<h3><a name="applying"></a>Applying</h3>

<p>Here’s the scary part. You’ve practically packed your bags, you have your papers
in order, you have a CV which stands out (and is formatted as your target
country prefers), you’ve picked your target country and you know their market
like the back of your  hand. You know you’re a great candidate. It’s time to
apply for jobs and this is where things break down for people. They don’t know
what to do. What I would tell them is “think of Charlie.” Charlie is a guy I
knew in Alaska who had a habit of getting jobs he wasn’t qualified for. At one
point, he was even a bank manager though his main skill was carpentry. How did
he get these jobs?</p>

<p>He applied for them.</p>

<p>It’s honestly that simple. Admittedly, Charlie had the gift of gab and could
talk his way into these jobs, but no employer is ever going to say yes unless
you ask. Don’t be afraid. Just pick up the job listings for your target country
— if you don’t know where to find them by now, you’re probably applying too soon
— and start sending your CV to the jobs you want.</p>

<p>However, there’s an even better trick if you can pull it off. Research their
employees on LinkedIn or other sites (employees who have related skills,
hopefully) and see if you can connect with them. Having Giorgi forward your
resume from inside the company is far better than just applying directly! That
being said, I applied directly for my first job in the UK, but I’m pretty
well-known in my field thanks to the tips I used earlier.</p>

<h3><a name="the-cover-letter"></a>The Cover Letter</h3>

<p>In today’s day and age, the cover letter seems a lost art. You’re going to
revive it. For every job you apply for, you will include a cover letter. You
will contact the company first and find out to whom you will be addressing this
letter. In the actual letter, you will mention their company by name, tell them
why you want the position, why they want to hire you, and drop details of what
you know about them, their competitors, and their market. You have to be very
careful with this letter. If it’s too long, people won’t read it, but you have
to convey enough that they pay more attention to your résumé than they usually
would.</p>

<p>If you’re not sure about how to write one, <a href="https://claude.ai/" target="_blank">try having Claude write a first
draft</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. Explain what you’re trying to do, give Claude all of
the relevant information, and you’ll soon have a good starting point.</p>

<p>What you don’t do in your cover letter is tell them that you need sponsorship
for a work permit. One of the things which was drilled into me repeatedly in car
sales (yeah, I used to sell cars, too) is that you never bring up anything
negative unless someone asks. They’re already going to see that you live in
another country. Your goal is to convince them that they have to have you.</p>

<p>Depending on your field and your qualifications, you may have to send out quite
a few résumés. You may get several callbacks right away or you may have to wait
months. Even if you get several callbacks, these could easily be the strangest
phone interviews you’ve ever had. In 2001, I got a job in Amsterdam, even after
one interviewer, knowing I’m originally from Texas, asked if I liked to carry
weapons. They’ll have stereotypes, too. You have to be prepared for these
interviews and that’s what we’ll cover in the next part.</p>

<p>Eventually you’ll get a phone interview and they’ll ask if you can legally work
in their country and that’s actually fantastic. It means that your résumé was
noticed. It also means you need know part three, how to handle the interview.</p>

<h2><a name="3-handling-the-phone-interview"></a>3. Handling the Phone Interview</h2>

<p>Note: some employers will fly you out to meet them. This is the exception, not
the rule. Also, the following applies to video calls, too.</p>

<p>So, you have a great résumé, you’ve done your research, you’ve applied for jobs
in your target country and you get an email in your inbox asking if you can be
ready for an interview at 9 AM on Monday morning.</p>

<p>Of course you can. You’ve worked your tail off for this moment and you’re not
going to blow it.</p>

<p>However, they might. I was once woken up by my phone ringing at 3AM because the
interviewer got their time zone wrong — and that was after I sent back a
confirmation email to verify the time in both my time zone and theirs. Of course
I still did the interview, but are you going to be prepared enough to handle an
interview if you’re woken up like that? Yes, you are.</p>

<p>You’re going to have a friend or two call you and give you an interview over the
phone or by video. They need to grill you hard and make sure they would really
want to hire you. They need to hit you with any and all objections they can
think of and you have to smoothly address every one of them. You will not fail
this interview.</p>

<p>Don’t stress the interview too much, though. If they’ve called an international
candidate, they’re already intrigued. If you’re an Italian with a hobbit fetish
and you desperately want to live in New Zealand, just remember that the New
Zealander interviewing you may find you — and your accent — as exotic as you
think of them. And this goes for Americans, too. Even though the rest of
the world is inundated with US movies and TV shows, I’ve still had ladies in
Europe tell me how much they loved my boring Midwest American accent (note
to my wife: they were ugly ladies. And old. Really old.)</p>

<p>You’re talking to a human being on the other end of the line and if they’ve
taken the trouble to call someone from another country, this is not a run of the
mill call. They’re going to be as curious about you as you are about them.
I’ve had international interviews quickly devolve into laughter and
discussion of local food and politics (which can be quite dangerous).</p>

<h3><a name="the-three-dangerous-questions"></a>The three dangerous questions</h3>

<p>No matter how well the interview goes, there are three questions you’re almost
guaranteed to be asked and you had better nail them.</p>

<ol>
<li>Why do you want to move to our country?</li>
<li>Can you legally work here?</li>
<li>How soon can you start?</li>
</ol>

<p>This is where all of your research is going to pay off, but for the “why do you
want to move here” question, you’re going to have to come up with your own
answer.</p>

<p>In 2006, I was interviewing for a role in the UK and was asked why I wanted to
move there, I mentioned that I had family in the UK and Germany and I wanted to
be closer to them. I also mentioned that I had previously visited the UK and I
loved the country. All of this was true and it made me sound like I understood
what was going on and not just fantasizing.</p>

<p>You probably don’t have relatives in the target country, so that’s out.
Hopefully you’ve at least visited. If you haven’t, you might be in for a
surprise. Some people who think they’d love London discover that it’s too
polluted and busy for them (I’ve several good friends who were disappointed by
the city). Not having visited hurts your chances, but if you haven’t, there’s
not much you can do.</p>

<p>At the very least, study the country’s history and current affairs like mad and
explain what parts of it you’re fascinated by and how much you’ve wanted to live
there and experience it first hand.</p>

<p>Remember, these are people on the other end of the line; they’ll probably
understand that answer. Most people have a hidden adventure streak in them and
there’s a good chance that you’ll be admired for it. However, don’t just say
“for the adventure.” Also, don’t say anything too negative about your home
country. You don’t know the person on the other end of the line and if they’re
turned off by politics or they happen to admire the politics of your country,
you may have sunk your boat. Stay positive!</p>

<p>The really problematic question is “can you legally work here?” This one will
also make or break you. If possible, I like to kick start an interview by asking
questions of the interviewer. I like to turn the interview into a dialogue, a
friendly chat, and forestall this question as long as possible. If it’s
addressed too early, you may not get a chance to sell yourself. When it’s asked,
though, the answer is simple:</p>

<p>“I need work permit before I start, but fortunately, the process is
pretty straightforward.”</p>

<p>This is why you’ve spent so much time learning exactly how the country’s work
permit system is structured. Explain how they can hire you. When the company in
Nottingham wanted to hire me, they were concerned that it would be difficult. I
assured them that it wasn’t and briefly outlined the process. Then I asked for
contact information in the company to whom I should explain the process in more
detail. I told them where to download forms, what fees they would be paying and
what papers they would need to provide. In short, I told my employer how to hire
me.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<p>At this point if they’re wavering, you need to close the deal. If you have a
sales background, you should isolate their objections and deal with them one by
one, but there are some issues here. First, you may not be trained to do this.
Second, you probably don’t know their culture and you may accidentally give
offense. Third, they may simply be too polite to tell you the problem or too
embarrassed to say that they don’t think they can afford you.</p>

<p>Assuming you think that they want to hire you, you can simply deal with the most
common objections outright. First, I tell them that my contract should have a
provision that I will repay all or some of the relocation costs if I leave the
company before a certain date. Another thing I did to guarantee my first UK move
was to tell them that I only had to bring over a few suitcases: I didn’t have a
household full of goods to move and that reduced relocation costs considerably.
They paid for a short-term flat for me, but I paid for my own plane ticket.</p>

<p>Finally, “how soon can you start” is the easy one. You’re already sick to death
of Count von Europe, but you’ve heeded the lesson and you have nothing holding
you back. Your answer is simply “I have to give X days notice to my employer. I
can start as soon as my work permit is approved.” The reality is that the work
permit will usually take a few months (this varies widely), so you’re waiting on
them rather than the other way around.</p>

<h2><a name="4-negotiating-the-salary"></a>4. Negotiating the Salary</h2>

<p>I was living in London and was back in the US for a friend’s wedding and eight
of us were at a Mexican restaurant for dinner. When it came time to pay the
bill, eight wallets came out, with an assortment of cards and cash. I thought
about it for a moment and realized that with the (then) exchange rate at $2 to
the British pound and with me living in what was then the second most expensive
city on the planet (or first, depending on the source), this dinner for eight
was about the price of dinner for two back home. I picked up the tab and saved
everyone a lot of hassle.</p>

<p>Money’s always a difficult and confusing topic and if you’re in the wonderful
position to negotiate the salary for a job in another country, you’ll want to
keep a number of things in mind.</p>

<p><strong>Exchange rates are for exchanging money.</strong></p>

<p>When I first moved overseas, I was a bit obsessed with staying on top of the
exchange rate. “How much is this carton of eggs in dollars?”</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter. What matters is whether or not something is cheap or
expensive relative to the local currency, so don’t stress about it unless ...</p>

<p>... you’re planning on returning to your home country a lot. That 30,000 baht a
month salary is fantastic in Thailand but it’s only about $1,000 US. If you’re a
Thai going to work in the US, great! If you’re an American going to work in
Thailand, you’ll want to be aware of this.</p>

<p><strong>That’s nice. Now tell me the salary to ask for.</strong></p>

<p>If you live in a foreign country, you’ll discover that the economy is as foreign
as the country. For example, when I lived in the Netherlands books were
typically around €16 to €18 (about $21US to $24US, at that time). Mind you, we’re talking about the cheap mass market paperback that will sold for $7 to $8 in the US.  Living in France, many excellent wines are dirt cheap and are often far better than the beer.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-2"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> Petrol (gas) in Europe is far more expensive than in the US and cigarette prices vary considerably from country to country. A €12 pack of cigarettes in France is €5.50 in Malta.</p>

<p>What this means is that when you’re naming a salary, you’re naming a salary
relative to what the job should earn, not relative to what you think you’ll need
for your cost of living. Try as you might, you will get it wrong if you try and
estimate the cost of living for yourself. Try
<a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/" target="_blank">Numbeo</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> if you want to understand the
cost of living better. You can also check out
<a href="https://www.ifitweremyhome.com/" target="_blank">ifitweremyhome.com</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> for more interesting
details about your target country.</p>

<p>What I recommend is naming a range. This sounds strange, but it works like this.
In the early 2000s, in London, many computer programmers earned between £35,000
and £55,000 a year. The lower end of your range should be close to the higher
end of typical salaries. You’re an expert and you don’t want to sell yourself
short. You’ll have to judge this carefully, though.</p>

<p>So you say, “I’d like to earn somewhere between X and Y a year, but it really
depends on holiday time, working conditions, or other benefits available. What
salary did you have in mind?”</p>

<p>At this point, you’ve given a range, made it clear you know what reasonable
salaries are, made it clear you’re flexible, and thrown it back in their lap.
And you’ve done it very professionally. And you know what? If they’re offering
eight weeks off a year, you might be quite happy to take a lower salary.</p>

<h3><a name="the-employment-contract"></a>The Employment Contract</h3>

<p>If you get this far, the actual employment contract will need some form of
relocation assistance. To guarantee my job in Nottingham, while I did receive a
very nice salary, I also offered to pay for my own transportation to the UK.
Generally, the employer will pay for your flight and the cost (if any) of moving
your goods. If you’ve offered to pay to secure the job, so be it (don’t offer to
pay unless you absolutely have to). Paying your own way means you don’t have to
repay if you decide to leave the position early (homesickness has ended the
dreams of many an expat).</p>

<p>In addition to the normal terms of an employment contract, you’ll have to ensure
that they’ve guaranteed you some initial accommodation. Most larger cities offer
some sort of “short-stay” apartment housing for people moving to a city. They
typically include a kitchen, so it’s a bit more than a hotel. If you’re working
in a low-paying industry (e.g., social worker) and they offer to let you
temporarily take a room in a coworker’s flat, consider it.</p>

<p>Also, if you’ll have trouble with rental deposits, ask the company if they can
provide a payroll loan to cover it? Make sure you ask before you fly over. Being
homeless is not fun (I speak from experience).</p>

<p>Finally, you might have to have a provision in there that if you leave before a
certain amount of time, you’ll repay some or all of the relocation expenses.
This is a normal condition, but make sure it’s not for too long of a time. I
probably wouldn’t go over a year, but it depends on the expenses.</p>

<p>So that’s about it. I’ve covered preparing your résumé, researching and applying
for jobs, interviewing and salary negotiations. This should give you a solid
plan for attacking the foreign job market. Be aware, though, that there are
plenty of other avenues to working overseas and this one is not guaranteed. It’s
simply a variant of the strategy that I took and I know it’s worked for others
too.</p>

<h1><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1>

<p>So that’s it. A four-step plan to move abroad. I never claimed it would be easy,
but you might be surprised! When I first started applying for jobs abroad, I
immediately had several companies interested (including MapQuest, but they kept
insisting I fly from the US to the UK on <em>my dime</em> for an interview, so I
ignored ‘em).</p>

<p>The only problem with the above plan is that it takes a while and for many,
that’s a reason not to start. Don’t let it be yours.</p>

<p>There are also <em>tons</em> of other routes abroad, many of which are obscure, such as
the <a href="https://itamcap.com/dual-citizenship/jure-sanguinis/" target="_blank">Italian Citizenship by
Descent</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> program. You can
claim Italian citizenship if the following criteria are met:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have male Italian ancestors living on/after March 17, 1861 could pass citizenship rights to descendants, unless they naturalized elsewhere before their child’s birth</li>
<li>Children born after January 1, 1948 to Italian mothers qualify</li>
<li>No generational limit exists, provided each ancestor maintained Italian citizenship eligibility before their child’s birth</li>
</ul>

<p>There are exceptions and Italian bureaucracy gives French bureaucracy a run for
its money, but it can be done. Then you <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/real-estate/g61420190/places-in-italy-to-buy-one-dollar-homes/" target="_blank">buy an Italian home for $1 and live
happily ever
after</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
(hint: it’s still hard work).</p>

<p>You can do this. If you want to live abroad, you have to put in the effort. Stop
dreaming and start doing.</p>
