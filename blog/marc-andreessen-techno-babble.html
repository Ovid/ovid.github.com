<h1><a name="forward"></a>Forward</h1>

<p>In the vein of Ted Kazinsky, Karl Marx, and others before him, Marc Andreessen
has proudly penned a manifesto, <a href="https://pmarca.substack.com/p/the-techno-optimist-manifesto" target="_blank">The Techno-Optimist
Manifesto</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. Or more
properly, “a rant.”</p>

<p>I chose the word “rant” with care. He’s ranting against something, but it’s a
terrible essay riddled with citations from racist writers (whom he admires),
straw men, false dilemmas, and reads like a high school sophomore barely
squeaked out a passing grade in a macroeconomics course.</p>

<p>Were it not for the fact that it’s authored by a famous billionaire, it would
just be another screed on another blog no one reads (like this one).</p>

<h1><a name="accelerationism"></a>Accelerationism</h1>

<p>The central thesis is the call for “accelerationism”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We believe in accelerationism – the conscious and deliberate propulsion of
  technological development – to ensure the fulfillment of the Law of Accelerating
  Returns. To ensure the techno-capital upward spiral continues forever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s possible that Andreessen isn’t aware that <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/11/11/20882005/accelerationism-white-supremacy-christchurch" target="_blank">fascists and white
supremacists love
accelerationism</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
but given all of the authors he cites, including admiration for “the father of
accelerationsim,” Nick Land, I strongly doubt this. Nick Land, in particular,
<a href="https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL771427A/Nick_Land" target="_blank">is often accused of advocating for “scientific racism” and
eugenics</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>Andreessen also calls for free markets and for people to stop hating technology.
The following assumes that he’s arguing in good faith and not deliberately using
deceptive arguments. Also, libertarians are, demographically, overwhelmingly
white males from rich countries and have <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/charles-koch-economics-nancy-maclean-book-james-buchanan-racism-education" target="_blank">long harbored white
supremacists</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
but there’s too much to unpack there, so that is (unfortunately) being left
out of this response.</p>

<h1><a name="techno-lust"></a>Techno-lust</h1>

<p>Let’s get the easy one out of the way.</p>

<p>Andreessen uses the word “technology” 48 times in his rant. He opens with this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are told that technology takes our jobs, reduces our wages, increases
  inequality, threatens our health, ruins the environment, degrades our society,
  corrupts our children, impairs our humanity, threatens our future, and is ever
  on the verge of ruining everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This encompasses two central themes in his work: the role of technology in
society and Andreessen’s inability to understand what people are complaining
about.</p>

<p>Let’s say I visit Andreessen’s house and I see a nail gun lying around. It’s a
bit of technology which either makes carpenter’s lives simpler or takes work
away from them, depending one’s point of view. I wouldn’t care if Andreessen has
a nail gun.</p>

<p>If, however, Andreessen was using that nail gun to kill puppies, I would
definitely care and Andreessen would apparently assume I have a problem with
nail guns.</p>

<p>Dear Marc: it’s not the thing we object to, it’s the abuse. As we read this on a
smart phone or a computer, as we ride our bikes to work, as MRIs diagnose
diseases and save our lives, few of us are objecting to those things.</p>

<p>Yes, there are certain <em>forms</em> of technology we object to because they’re
inherently harmful—internal combustion engines (ICE), for example—but until we
have a suitable replacement, no one’s calling for outlawing ICE tomorrow. Even
when <a href="https://www.energyintel.com/00000187-28b5-df45-a9df-7cf51aac0000" target="_blank">Europe banned the sale of new ICE after
2035</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> the time frame was an explicit acknowledgement of the benefits of this
technology, while also pointing out the obvious dangers of it.</p>

<p>It’s not technology people object to. Andreessen’s argument is a straw man. He
extols the virtues of technology with drooling ecstasy, ignoring that virtue
stems from humanity, not tools.</p>

<h1><a name="free-markets"></a>Free Markets</h1>

<p>Andreessen writes, “We believe free markets are the most effective way to
organize a technological economy.” Two paragraphs later he then rails against
central planning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We believe Hayek’s Knowledge Problem overwhelms any centralized economic
  system. All actual information is on the edges, in the hands of the people
  closest to the buyer. The center, abstracted away from both the buyer and the
  seller, knows nothing. Centralized planning is doomed to fail, the system of
  production and consumption is too complex. Decentralization harnesses complexity
  for the benefit of everyone; centralization will starve you to death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hayek’s “Knowledge Problem” refers to the famous article <a href="https://www.kysq.org/docs/Hayek_45.pdf" target="_blank">The Use of Knowledge
in Society</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> (pdf), by Friedrich Hayek.
In this writing, he skewers the notion that central planning can lead to
effective economic outcomes. It’s a good, important work and should be read by
anyone who wishes a better understanding of the limits of central planning.</p>

<p>Andreessen sets up the great debate, writing “centralized planning is doomed to
fail, the system of production and consumption is too complex.” He attacks
communism several times, to make it clear that it’s the communist bogeyman he’s
warning us about. He also positively cites libertarian works to let us know that
<em>laissez-faire</em> is our Savior and Lord.</p>

<p>There are two little problems with him setting up the epic battle of free
markets versus central planning. The most obvious is that no one is arguing
for central planning. Marx’s ideas, like Marx himself, are dead. There are
few economists who take him seriously. Even the Chinese Communist Party <a href="https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2018/number/5/article/chinas-socialist-market-economy-a-systemic-trade-issue.html" target="_blank">has
shifted to a “socialist market
economy”</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
recognizing that central planning doesn’t work. Communism and central planning
are safely in the hands of barstool philosophers and pose no threat.</p>

<p>The other problem is that he’s setting up a <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/false-dichotomy" target="_blank">false
dichotomy</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. In a tremendously
complex world with radically different value systems across its face and
mounting climate and ecological chaos, reducing one of the core debates to naïve
dualism isn’t enlightening anyone.</p>

<p>However, his writing isn’t always bad.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We believe there is no conflict between capitalist profits and a social
  welfare system that protects the vulnerable. In fact, they are aligned – the
  production of markets creates the economic wealth that pays for everything else
  we want as a society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve met many a libertarian who argues strongly against welfare on the grounds
that people should tend their own estates and government handouts take away our
incentive to succeed. Tell that to a single mom working at McDonalds to support
two children.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-2"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> So Kudos to Andreessen for suggesting
that social welfare systems are OK.</p>

<p>Curiously, Andreessen later writes, “We believe a Universal Basic Income would
turn people into zoo animals to be farmed by the state.” This was stuck in the
middle of the manifesto like a porcupine in a petting zoo. I read the text
around that several times and I still have no idea what it means, but like most
of the rant, it was a bizarre assertion without justification.</p>

<h1><a name="capitalism"></a>Capitalism</h1>

<p>While ranting about communism, telling us that only free market capitalism can
save us, he blithely ignores the central problem with capitalism today. Yes, he
is correct about the power of markets. Prior to capitalism, the world was
largely guided by
<a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/topic/mercantilism" target="_blank">mercantilism</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. Capitalism
supplanted mercantilism by proving that economics wasn’t a zero-sum game.
Eventually, we should hope for a post-capitalist society that addresses the
fatal flaw of capitalism: it has no mechanism for handling
<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2010/12/basics.htm" target="_blank">externalities</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-3"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<p>I don’t know what a successful post-capitalist economic system would look like
any more than a mercantilist would have predicted capitalism. Two of the most
significant externalities we face today are climate change and ecosystem
collapse, but we clearly see that laissez-faire capitalism can’t deal with it
effectively. This isn’t just some lefty idea. <a href="https://www.defense.gov/spotlights/tackling-the-climate-crisis/" target="_blank">The US Department of Defense
considers climate change a national security
priority</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> The
US military isn’t traditionally associated with radicals or lefties.</p>

<p>So Andreessen, by pulling the typical libertarian trick of ignoring the central
problem with capitalism, successfully guts his own screed.</p>

<h1><a name="market-discipline"></a>Market Discipline</h1>

<p>This part is just bizarre. Andreessen writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We believe in market discipline. The market naturally disciplines – the seller either learns and changes when the buyer fails to show, or exits the market. When market discipline is absent, there is no limit to how crazy things can get. The motto of every monopoly and cartel, every centralized institution not subject to market discipline: “We don’t care, because we don’t have to.” Markets prevent monopolies and cartels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I confess that I laughed myself silly at that last sentence.</p>

<p>OK, before we unpack this, we need to understand what “market discipline” is. Per <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market-discipline.asp" target="_blank">Investopedia</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Market discipline is the onus on banks, financial institutions, sovereigns, and other major players in the financial industry to conduct business while considering the risks to their stakeholders. Market discipline is a market-based promotion of the transparency and disclosure of the risks associated with a business or entity. It works in concert with regulatory systems to increase the safety and soundness of the market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a couple of interesting things to note about this. First, it talks
about risks to <em>stakeholders</em>, nobody else. Risks to customers can become risks
to stakeholders, but only if the customers realize that risk. Risks to
non-customers, such as from pollution? Who cares? Not their problem. And while
Andreessen approvingly quotes Adam Smith about the nature of “self-interest,”
<a href="https://scholarlycommons.law.case.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1588&amp;context=caselrev" target="_blank">there’s another quote of Smith’s which Andreessen didn’t bother to
include</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
(pdf):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and
  diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in
  some contrivance to raise prices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That, by the way, is from a law review paper entitled “Adam Smith on the
Inevitability of Price Fixing.” The quote further reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any law
  which either could be executed, or would be consistent with
  liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder people
  of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it
  ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to
  render them necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no market mechanism to protect against this. The only recourse is in
the second interesting thing in Investopedia’s definition of market discipline:
regulatory systems. The market’s internal mechanisms for protecting the public
have a core problem: businesses are comprised of people and sometimes people
think they can get away with stuff and, sometimes, they can. If you decide that
Coke, Pepsi, and other products are bad, you can easily switch to water. But
what if there is no substitute? Think “insulin.”</p>

<p>And if the market is so great at preventing cartels, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/chapter-4" target="_blank">why is the US Department
of Justice on a tear, prosecuting so many of
them</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>?</p>

<p>This naïvete about “market discpline” is a symptom of libertarian groupthink.</p>

<p>It’s also worth reading <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/~wainwrig/Econ400/akerlof.pdf" target="_blank">The Market for
Lemons</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> (pdf), an economic
paper that won the author a Nobel Prize. It describes how markets degrade when
the seller has more information about their product than the buyer. This is
called “information asymmetry” and there is, again, nothing in the market
mechanism which can guard against this. Even in our “information age,” the buyer
often has little way of knowing if the product they’re buying has defects.</p>

<p>Or you can read about <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/consumerist/dealerships-rip-you-off-with-the-four-square-heres-how-to-beat-it/" target="_blank">the
four-square</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
an unethical, but perfectly legal technique into pressuring people to pay too
much money for a car. Again, the market can’t prevent this. In fact, it
<em>incentivizes</em> this unethical behavior to the detriment of the consumer.</p>

<h1><a name="luddites"></a>Luddites</h1>

<p>In addition to railing against the non-existent communist threat, he implies
that those who object to our current situation are Luddites:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This upward [techno-capital economic] spiral has been running for hundreds of
  years, despite continuous howling from Communists and Luddites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Luddites? In the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, <a href="https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/The-Luddites/" target="_blank">the Luddites
were</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>British weavers and textile workers who objected to the introduction of mechanised looms and knitting frames. As highly trained artisans, the new machinery posed a threat to their livelihood and after receiving no support from government, they took matters into their own hands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were being replaced by low-skilled workers and many of the skilled workers
found themselves out of work and starving.</p>

<p>At first blush, this <em>does</em> seem to resemble people like me, <a href="/articles/using-github-copilot-with-vim.html">worried that my
skilled labor is going to be replaced by
AI</a>, but this is a faulty
comparison.</p>

<p>Eventually, the financial boom created by the Industrial Revolution translated
into <a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/IndustrialRevolutionandtheStandardofLiving.html" target="_blank">new jobs and an increased standard of
living</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
The interim was rough for workers because the government was only acting in the
interest of the wealthy and it took decades before those workers found skilled
work that the machines could not do.</p>

<p>With how powerful the new AI is <strong>in its infancy</strong>, where will be the skilled
work the AI can’t do? <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-create-an-app/" target="_blank">People are already using ChatGPT to help them build
entire apps</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lost+my+job+to+chatgpt" target="_blank">plenty of people are losing their jobs to
ChatGPT</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. As this new
technology improves, more jobs will be lost. Unlike the Luddites of old, today’s
Luddites are facing a future where there will be few jobs this technology cannot
do. When we fully combine it with robotics to replace manual labor, the future
looks grim.</p>

<p>What are we to do when we’re losing our homes and can’t afford to eat?
Presumably, Andreessen’s answer will be something along the lines of “let them
eat cake.”</p>

<p>More likely, since he’s a billionaire, he adheres to the unofficial libertarian
motto: “screw you; I got mine.”</p>
