<h1><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>

<p>Few questions intrigue us as much as “are we alone in the universe.” Like many,
I’m obsessed with the topic. So obsessed, in fact, that the National Library of
Finland released an hour-long talk I gave on the subject.</p>

<div class="video-responsive">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjAFqqHR6vc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>I’ve also <a href="/blog/searching-for-extraterrestrial-life-in-our-solar-system.html">previously written on this
topic</a> and
the above talk is an in-depth expansion of what I’ve written earlier, but hardly
scratches the surface. But to understand a bit more about whether or not there
is life elsewhere in the universe, let’s look at some of the background.</p>

<h1><a name="the-drake-equation"></a>The Drake Equation</h1>

<p>The Drake Equation is a famous <em>probablistic</em> equation created by Dr. Frank
Drake in 1961. In this equation $N$ is the estimated number of intelligent
civilizations we might be able to detect.</p>

<p>$$N = R_* \times f_p \times n_e \times f_l \times f_i \times f_c \times L$$</p>

<ul>
<li>$R_*$ – Average rate of annual star formation in the Milky Way galaxy</li>
<li>$f_p$ – Fraction of those with planets</li>
<li>$n_e$ – Fraction of those planets which can support life</li>
<li>$f_l$ – Fraction of those which <em>develop</em> life</li>
<li>$f_i$ – Fraction of those which develop <em>intelligent</em> life</li>
<li>$f_c$ – Fraction of those generating detectable signals</li>
<li>$L$ – Lifespan of those signals</li>
</ul>

<p>The variables $R_{*}$ through $f_{c}$, when multiplied together, tell us how
many intelligent civilizations “mature” per year, to the point where they can be
detected. Multiply that by $L$, the last term, and you have an estimate of the
total number of intelligent civilizations we might detect at any one time.</p>

<p>At the time the equation was created, we didn’t know any of those numbers, but
<a href="https://www.seti.org/drake-equation-index" target="_blank">Drake himself estimated that $N$ was around
10,000</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. Today, we have been slowly
knocking those numbers down, one by one. Of those we think we know the what the
values are, we have:</p>

<ul>
<li>$R_*$ – Average rate of annual star formation in the Milky Way galaxy (6-7)</li>
<li>$f_p$ – Fraction of those with planets (50% to 100%; probably closer to 100%)</li>
<li>$n_e$ – Fraction of those planets which can support life (1?)</li>
</ul>

<p>The last number, “Fraction of planets which can support life”, is often reported
as $1$, but we already know that <a href="/blog/searching-for-extraterrestrial-life-in-our-solar-system.html">many moons in our solar system might support
life</a>. So we
could easily have multiple “planets” per system which could support life. We
think there are between <a href="https://www.space.com/25959-how-many-stars-are-in-the-milky-way.html" target="_blank">100 to 400 <em>billion</em> stars in our
galaxy</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
so that could easily lead to over a <em>trillion</em> heavenly bodies which could
support life in our galaxy alone!</p>

<p>We don’t know how many stars are in our universe, but <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Herschel/How_many_stars_are_there_in_the_Universe" target="_blank">current estimate suggest
there might be between $10^{22}$ to $10^{24}$
stars</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
That’s up to 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars!</p>

<p>So what about the number of planets which develop life, have intelligent life,
and so on? We have no idea what those numbers are. However, that doesn’t mean we
know nothing about those numbers. We exist, Therefore, all of those numbers are
greater than zero. The first, $f_l$ (fraction of planets which develop life) is
what we’ll focus on here because if that number is too low, none of the others
matter.</p>

<h1><a name="not-detecting-life"></a>(Not) Detecting Life</h1>

<p>You may have read in the news lately about a new method of detecting life on
Mars: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42170-6" target="_blank">DNA sequencing at the picogram level to investigate life on Mars and
Earth</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. This is remarkable
work, but to point out the obvious—which the authors of the work are certainly
aware of—what if the alien life doesn’t have DNA?<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> In a paper entitled
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8171722_Is_There_a_Common_Chemical_Model_for_Life_in_the_Universe" target="_blank">Is There a Common Chemical Model for Life in the
Universe?</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
by Benner, Steven &amp; Ricardo, Alonso and Carrigan, Matthew. (2005), point out
that most “universal” probes for life target the ribosome, present in virtually
all life on Earth. Again, what if the life doesn’t have ribosomes? Using this
as a tool to detect life won’t work and we know nothing about alien life (if it
exists), so can’t make strong statements about what that life is likely to be.</p>

<p>There might be another approach, though. Two Viking landers arrived on Mars in
the 1970s and <a href="/blog/searching-for-extraterrestrial-life-in-our-solar-system.html#mars">their labeled release experiment might have detected
life</a>.
In short, in separate experiments conduction over 6,000 kilometers apart, the
landers injected Martian regolith (the surface material on Mars) with a
radioactive nutrient solution and <em>something</em> interacted with the solution and
released the radioactive carbon-14. It looked an awful lot like metabolism. It
might just have been a chemical reaction. We don’t know.</p>

<p>What’s interesting about the Viking Lander experiments is that they weren’t
searching for specific chemicals. They were looking for a <em>biosignature</em>
indicative of life. Yes, we made assumptions about the “nutrient” solution,
using <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6445182/" target="_blank">seven molecules found in the Miller-Urey
experiment</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, but trying
to have an agnostic approach to detecting life was promising. That brings us to
Assembly Theory.</p>

<h1><a name="assembly-theory"></a>Assembly Theory</h1>

<p>Detecting alien life is a tricky business because:</p>

<ol>
<li>We don’t know if it exists</li>
<li>If it does exist, we have no idea what it’s composed of</li>
</ol>

<p>Assembly Theory was first proposed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leroy_Cronin" target="_blank">Professor Leroy
Cronin</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, the Regius Chair of
Chemistry in the School of Chemistry at the University of Glasgow. Instead of
just asking what a molecule <em>is</em>, he asked how it came to be. In other words,
how was it assembled? He’s established the notion of a “molecular assembly
index” (MA) which represents the minimum number of steps necessary to assemble a
given molecule.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-2"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<p>Consider the word “going.” Imagine that each letter is an atom floating around which can freely attach to other atoms to form words. The MA of a single letter is zero because it already exists. However, when you add the letter “o” to the letter “g”—forming “go”—you have an MA of 1, because one step has occurred.  When you then add the letter “i”—forming “goi”—you have an MA of 2, and so on.  The word “going” therefore has an MA of 4. Of course, by the constraints we’ve listed, all other possible combinations, such as “oin” (MA of 2), “in” (MA of 1), and so on, are floating around in our primordial soup.</p>

<p>But consider the word “hodgepodge.” By the time we’ve assembled “hodgep”, we
have an MA of 5. You might think the word “hopgepodge” has an MA of 9, but
remember that substrings of “hodgepodge” are floating around, too. One of those
substrings is “odge” and can attach to “hodgep” in a single step, giving us a
final MA of 6, not 9.</p>

<p>Of course, chemistry is much harder than spelling. Molecules are 3D structures
and individual atoms don’t form bonds randomly with all other atoms. But you get
the basic idea.</p>

<p>In the paper, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23258-x" target="_blank">Identifying molecules as biosignatures with assembly theory and
mass spectrometry</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
(Marshall, S.M., Mathis, C., Carrick, E. et al.), Professor Cronin and his
colleagues took the time to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>calculate the complexity of several million molecules and validate that their
  complexity can be experimentally determined by mass spectrometry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their findings?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These results demonstrate that we can identify the living systems by looking
  for mixtures with an MA greater than a certain threshold. In the case of the
  analysis presented here it appears that only living samples produced MA
  measurement above ~15.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In short, molecules with an MA above 15 were invariably produced by life, while
molecules below that might be produced by both abiotic or biotic processes. If
these results hold, we might have a “universal” method of detecting life, with
the caveat that if there’s life that only generates molecules with lower MA
numbers, we’ll still not detect it. However, this approach seems rather
promising.</p>

<p>To give some context, sometimes you’ll read breathless news articles proclaiming
that we’ve found “complex” organic molecules in space. For context, organic
molecules are just molecules with carbon-hydrogen or carbon-carbon bonds
They’re all over the place because carbon is one of the
easiest molecules to form bonds with. One of those “complex” organic molecules
found in space is ethyl
formate. It has an MA of 3. The molecule n-propyl cyanide has also been seen in
space. It also has an MA of 3.</p>

<p>In fact, most complex organic molecules in space have rather low MA numbers and
it’s not hard to imagine abiotic processes producing them. On the other hand,
<a href="https://phys.org/news/2023-06-evidence-amino-acid-tryptophan-space.html" target="_blank">we may have detected tryptophan around the IC348 star
system</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
about 1,000 light years away. Tryptophan has an MA of 11.</p>

<p><em>(If you’d like to check these numbers, <a href="https://gist.github.com/Ovid/a2e828965ce3586a83bfedd7e86a8d20" target="_blank">I wrote a script to do that for
you</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, but it
requires the <a href="http://molecular-assembly.com/query/" target="_blank">Molecular Assembly REST
API</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. That doesn’t always seem to return
results. In correspondence with Dr. Cronin, he confirms they’re working on a new
version)</em></p>

<p>Throughout all of the above, keep in mind that Assembly Theory, like all new
scientific endeavors, has its detractors.</p>

<h1><a name="what-if-we-find-life"></a>What If We Find Life?</h1>

<p>Three things. Given that there are possibly a trillion or more candidate places
for life to come into being in just our galaxy, given that we know $f_l$ is
greater than zero, and given that we’re seeing more and more complex chemistry
in our own solar system which would be easy to explain biologically (were we to
know the biology is there), I’m gradually leaning to the idea that we are
probably not alone in the universe. Of course, that’s a hunch, not science.</p>

<p>In the fifth century BCE, the Greek philosopher-scientist <a href="https://bigthink.com/the-past/aliens-greek-philosophers-history/" target="_blank">Anaxagorus speculated
that there was life on the
moon</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. Many
have speculated about this throughout history and certainly in pre-history. That
we have so many religions asserting non-human intelligences with whom we can
communicate is part of this longing of ours to know that we’re not alone in the
universe.</p>

<p>Finding life, but not intelligent life, will not be enough to satisfy us, but it
will be an amazing step forwards in filling in the last of the variables in the
Drake Equation. Further, if we find life in our own solar system, but it has a
different origin from our own, it’s virtually impossible that the only two 
abiogenesis events in the universe happened in the same solar system. The 
universe would be teeming with life.</p>

<p>For those wondering about abiogenesis (the origin of life from non-life), here’s 
a video by Sabine Hossenfelder describing our current thinking on the topic.</p>
