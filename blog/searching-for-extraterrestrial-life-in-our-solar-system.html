<h1><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>

<p>The question of whether or not we’re alone in the universe is a profound one.
There is something terribly sad at the idea that our star is the only one that
shines down on life. <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Herschel/How_many_stars_are_there_in_the_Universe" target="_blank">With a possible lower bound of $10^{22}$ stars in our
universe</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span><span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> and a
universe almost 14 billion years old, that’s an average of almost two million
stars created <em>every day</em>. While estimates of the number of planets vary, we
think there are probably at least as many “Earth-like” planets as there are
stars, that seems like two million chances <em>per day</em> of life being created. Of
course, it’s much more than that because for every day that a planet doesn’t
have life evolve, it has plenty of additional days, years, <em>eons</em> for life to
evolve.</p>

<p>Given the preceding, many people are convinced that life is plentiful in the
universe, but so far, we’ve never detected extraterrestrial life amongst the
stars. Are we alone?  Maybe. However, we should look closer to home. In fact,
there are many intriguing clues in our own solar system which are worth
examining. I’ll cover some of them, but I’ll save the best for last because
it’s very exciting, even if we did overlook it for decades.</p>

<p>First, I want a to give a some background information for those who are
curious about the search for extraterrestrial life but haven’t dug into the
topic, just how complex it is. If that’s less interesting to you, <a href="#searching-for-life-off-world">you can
skip ahead to the best candidates for life in our solar
system</a>.</p>

<h1><a name="caveats"></a>Caveats</h1>

<p>As with any writing on this topic, everything here is going to be a gross
oversimplification. Unlike many other writings on this topic, I’m going to try
to give a broad (but not deep) background into many of the issues involved.
Sometimes I’ll provide additional caveats that might distract from the text, so
you can click on the "<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-2"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span>" symbol for more
context.</p>

<h2><a name="life-as-we-know-it"></a>Life (as we know it)</h2>

<p>First, when I write “life,” mentally add the words “as we know it” after that. I
get tired of typing it. The definition of life is muddled, to put it kindly, and
we only have one tree of life as a sample. We have no idea what alien
lifeforms might be like.</p>

<h2><a name="aliens"></a>Aliens?</h2>

<p><figure class="captioned">
    <img src="/static/images/aliens-on-mars.png" width="600" alt="An image of aliens in weird spacesuits standing on Mars.">
    <figcaption>Not gonna happen. <a href="https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release" target="_blank">Source</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>Always remember that if the question is aliens, the answer is “no.” This might
seem surprising to some who’ve attended my talks and heard me warn about those
who use words like “always” and “never” in describing complex topics. People
who use those words are often zealots. I don’t <em>think</em> I’m a zealot, but the
default position of those who understand science is that extraordinary claims
require extraordinary evidence.  The existence of extraterrestrial life would
be one of the most extraordinary claims of all time. So far, there’s no
evidence of aliens. Thus, your default position should be “no aliens.”<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-3"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<h2><a name="organic-compounds"></a>Organic Compounds</h2>

<p>You often hear the term “organic compounds” or “organic molecules” in connection
with the search for life. Be careful.</p>

<p>In chemistry, organic compounds are just chemical compounds that contain
carbon-hydrogen covalent bonds. In the popular press, we tend to use the term to
mean any compound containing carbon, but it’s widely misinterpreted as
“molecules related to life.” They <em>are</em> often related to life, but “organic,” in
this context, does not mean life.</p>

<h1><a name="the-drake-equation"></a>The Drake Equation</h1>

<p>Before we can search for life, we have to define it. But before we get there,
let’s think about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation" target="_blank">Drake
Equation</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. This was created in the
1960s by the late Dr. Frank Drake as a <em>thought experiment</em>. Like “organic
compounds,” this is also widely misunderstood. I’ve often seen it referred to as
an equation that helps us understand the prevalence of life in the universe. In
reality, it’s a tool to help us understand the possible number of currently
communicating extraterrestrial civilizations that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence" target="_blank">SETI</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
might be able to detect. For the equation, the number $N$ is the number of
civilizations we might be able to detect. The equation looks like this:</p>

<p>$$N = R_{*} ~ \times ~ f_{p} ~ \times ~ n_{e} ~ \times ~ f_{l} ~ \times ~ f_{i} ~ \times ~ f_{c} ~ \times ~ L$$</p>

<p>Those terms are:</p>

<ul>
<li>$R_∗$: the average rate of star formation in our galaxy</li>
<li>$f_p$: the fraction of those stars that have planets</li>
<li>$n_e$: the average number of planets that can potentially support life per star that has planets</li>
<li>$f_l$: the fraction of planets that could support life that actually develop life at some point</li>
<li>$f_i$: the fraction of planets with life that actually go on to develop intelligent life (civilizations)</li>
<li>$f_c$: the fraction of civilizations that develop a technology that releases detectable signs of their existence into space</li>
<li>$L$: the length of time for which such civilizations release detectable signals into space</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on how you fill in those numbers, we could be alone in the universe,
or we could have many advanced extraterrestrial civilizations within our galaxy.</p>

<p>For our purposes, we’re most interested in $f_l$: how often does life evolve? In
fact, we’re not even interested in just planets because life could possibly
evolve on a moon (there are several interesting candidates). Some
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia" target="_blank">panspermia</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> advocates even claim that
life could have evolved in space, though this isn’t taken seriously by most
scientists.</p>

<p>To be more specific, we’re asking “what are the odds of life spontaneously
originating from simple organic compounds?”<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-4"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> This is known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis" target="_blank">abiogenesis</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and is the subject of
much research. The current consensus on an answer is, “we have no fucking
idea.” What’s particularly maddening about this is that we’re not likely to
have a clue <em>until</em> we detect other life. If we don’t detect life, that
doesn’t mean it’s not plentiful (absence of evidence is not evidence of
absence).</p>

<p>But if detect a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosignature" target="_blank">biosignature</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technosignature" target="_blank">technosignature</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> of life on a
star on the other side of our galaxy, that might only put a lower bound on the
amount of life out there, not an upper. We’ll need multiple detections of life
to get a good sense of its ubiquity. Nonetheless, detecting <em>any</em> other life
outside our solar system suggests that it’s common throughout the universe.</p>

<p>So now it’s time to ask the hard question: What is life?</p>

<h1><a name="what-is-life"></a>What Is Life?</h1>

<p>Again, this must be prefaced with the “life as we know it” caveat. And I’ll
come right out and say what’s on my mind: most definitions of life are a
steaming pile of shit.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/life" target="_blank">One definition of life</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, as
taken from Merriam-Webster, is “an organismic state characterized by capacity
for metabolism, growth, reaction to stimuli, and reproduction.”</p>

<p>Right off the bat we see a problem. Mules, for example, don’t reproduce.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-5"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> Would you say
they’re not alive? Of course not.</p>

<p>And what about fire? <a href="https://newworlds.colorado.edu/search/life.htm" target="_blank">It reacts to stimuli and
grows</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. We could even argue that
it metabolizes what it consumes for energy to keep growing, but we don’t think
of it as “alive.”</p>

<p>There are other properties of life, however.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis" target="_blank">Homeostasis</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> is the body’s ability
to internally regulate itself and keep functioning. Does fire exhibit
homeostasis? It’s hard to argue that it does. However, warm-blooded and
cold-blooded animals have completely different approaches to homeostasis and
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169534712002947" target="_blank">homeostasis evolved over
time</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
so there are different levels of homeostasis. Maybe we can argue that humans
have a homeostasis level of ten while fire has a homeostasis level of one? A
piece of flint, however, might have a homeostasis level of zero.</p>

<p>But why would we argue that?</p>

<h2><a name="life-as-biopresentation"></a>Life as Biopresentation</h2>

<p>When I was working on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load" target="_blank">ETL</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> systems to
reduce the cost of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial#Phases" target="_blank">Phase III clinical
trials</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, I often found
myself working with data supplied by many pharmaceutical companies. Company A
might refer to “Dr. Robert Smith, St. Mary’s Hospital, Arlington, Virginia.”
Company B might refer to “Dr. Bob Smith, St. May’s Hospital, Arlington,
Virginia.” Are they the same person? “St. May’s Hospital” might be a typo.
“Bob” is short for “Robert.” Maybe they <em>are</em> the same person.</p>

<p>In reality, it’s hard to definitively state “yes” or “no.” Instead, I had
access to tons of information about each researcher, including email
addresses, phone numbers, ages, and so on. I would assign scores (how
reliable) and weights (how important) to each piece of data and if two
researchers crosses a certain threshold, they were <em>probably</em> the same
researcher.</p>

<p>This same approach should be taken to the definition of life. Instead of life
being a binary “yes or no,” we should describe its “biopresentation,”<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-6"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> or “how present are the signs of life in a ‘thing.'”
So for a virus:</p>

<table>

	<th>Value</th>

<p>In the above, a virus might have a biopresentation of 20. A human,
however, would be radically different:</p>

<p>A human might have a biopresentation score of 100.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-7"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<p>This would be particularly useful in describing abiogenesis. <a href="https://sciencing.com/abiogenesis-definition-theory-evidence-examples-13719058.html" target="_blank">One hypothesis of
abiogenesis is</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Prebiotic atmosphere with ammonia, carbon dioxide and water vapor.</li>
<li>Lightning produces simple organic compounds that fall into solution in shallow water.</li>
<li>The compounds react further in a prebiotic broth, forming amino acids.</li>
<li>The amino acids link up with peptide bonds to form polypeptide chain proteins.</li>
<li>The proteins combine into more complex molecules that can replicate and metabolize simple substances.</li>
<li>Complex molecules and organic compounds form lipid membranes around themselves and start acting like living cells.</li>
</ol>

<p>At all steps along the way, we could have something closer to what we call
“life,” though the initial steps might have a biopresentation level of zero.
Instead of life being a fixed point, it’s a gradual process. We don’t point to
a thing and say “this is alive” because that gets us back to the arguments of
what life is or isn’t. We simply describe its biopresentation.</p>

<p>This would be useful for biology today, too. Consider the endless arguments
about whether or not <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=are+viruses+alive&amp;oq=are+viruses+alive" target="_blank">viruses are
live</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
It’s often argued that viruses aren’t alive because they can’t metabolize
outside of their host. That reduces metabolism to the primary (or sole)
attribute of life.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-8"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> But <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/anabolism-catabolism-definition-examples-4178390" target="_blank">metabolism is
the global term for anabolism and
catabolism</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
Catobolism is just breaking complex stuff into simpler stuff while anabolism
is using that simpler stuff to do more complex stuff. Fire catabolizes, but
doesn’t anabolize. Viruses do both. So maybe they’re alive? But some still
reject that because, again, they can’t do that without a suitable host.</p>

<p>But what’s a host? Obligate parasites such as the protozoan Plasmodium<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-9"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span>
can’t survive outside of their hosts. Or consider humans. If I drop you
into the middle of interstellar space without a space suit, you’ll stop
metabolizing, too. So the context in which we can biopresent is also a
spectrum. Viruses are starting to look more alive.</p>

<p>But wait! There’s more!</p>

<p>Most living beings have some ability to communicate with one another. Maybe
all do. As it turns out, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-you-speak-virus-phages-caught-sending-chemical-messages1/" target="_blank">we’ve know for a few years that viruses can do this,
too</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
The human communication score might be at a “ten,” while viral communication
might be a “one,” but fire’s communication is “zero.” The weight of this
factor is probably pretty high, so fire’s biopresentation would be pretty low,
but viruses could be easily crossing the threshold.</p>

<p>Pragmatist that I am, I want to skip the philosophical debates about whether
or not something is alive and go with the pragmatic discussion of how closely
something resembles life. However, we can’t ignore the philosophical
implications.</p>

<h2><a name="philosophical-objections-to-biopresentation"></a>Philosophical Objections to Biopresentation</h2>

<p>At this point, I can see many biologists howling at the above. In a 2013 Wired
article entitled <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/01/living-crystal/" target="_blank">It’s (Almost) Alive! Scientists Create a Near-Living
Crystal</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, the lede reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Three billion years after inanimate chemistry first became animate life, a
  newly synthesized laboratory compound is behaving in uncannily lifelike
  ways. The particles aren’t truly alive — but they’re not far off, either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crystals created had metabolism and mobility, but couldn’t reproduce. <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsta.2013.0372" target="_blank">You
can read the original study at The Royal Society
website</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>For these crystals, one could argue that a), they’re not alive, or b), what
their relative biopresentation level is. Some people would be uncomfortable
describing crystals as alive, but if we’re to search for life elsewhere in the
universe, are we going to argue that life which doesn’t share the same
biochemical basis as our own isn’t alive?</p>

<p>Or consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_machine" target="_blank">self-replicating Von Neumann
machine</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. By the
biopresentation argument, they would likely score very high, but are machines
“alive”? Or apply biopresentation to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/gaia-hypothesis" target="_blank">The Gaia
Hypothesis</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
Is our planet alive? That’s definitely a philosophical question, but in light
of biopresentation, depending on what factors to include, we could make a
strong argument that it is.</p>

<h2><a name="why-is-rethinking-life-important"></a>Why is rethinking life important?</h2>

<p>What does this have to do with searching for life off Earth? It’s simple.  If
we go with a binary “yes/no” for life, it means that we have defined a limited,
possibly incorrect, set of properties necessary to define life.  Something not
meeting those conditions might be disregarded. If, however, biopresentation is
adopted, we can start defining “lifelike” properties and perhaps not be so
quick to dismiss something that is otherwise alive.</p>

<p>If that seems stretched, consider the “Shadow Biosphere,” an idea that there
may be another biosphere on Earth that we’ve not yet detected. The idea’s not
popular, but it seems persistent. Here’s Fraser Cain, the founder and
publisher of Universe Today, describing it.</p>

<div class="video-responsive">
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2brd-3OVgn8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>Ultimately, if there is a shadow biosphere on Earth and we can’t detect it,
this doesn’t bode well for detecting life off Earth.</p>

<h1><a name="searching-for-life-off-world"></a>Searching for Life Off-World</h1>

<p>We can search for biosignatures in other star systems, but until we can
visit<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-10"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span>, it’s likely to be controversial.
Technosignatures are more promising because a receiving a radio transmission
of a sequence of prime numbers followed by an encoded message is pretty
conclusive. But in the absence of technosignatures, we need to fall back on
biosignatures and in our own solar system, we can definitely visit.</p>

<p>First, let’s remove a few unlikely candidates. They’re candidates because we
can envision life being there. They’re unlikely because it may not be “life as
we know it” and thus are less likely to recognize it as life. We might even
exclude them for a practical reason: it’s hard to visit them with current
technology and we’re unlikely to be able to detect life if we do so due to the
limited equipment we can bring.</p>

<h2><a name="unlikely-candidates"></a>Unlikely Candidates</h2>

<p>If you’re looking for information on extraterrestrial candidates for life in
our solar system, they’re plentiful. I’m of the opinion that we should
investigate all of them, given how hugely important I value the idea of
finding a second (and third, and fourth, ...) abiogenesis, but as a practical
matter, we need to consider the cost (biosignatures on Pluto wouldn’t
necessarily justify the resources needed to launch a mission there) and
whether we have detected biosignatures. When it comes to searching for life,
low-cost targets with biosignatures <em>must</em> be our first priority.</p>

<h3><a name="triton"></a>Triton</h3>

<p><figure class="captioned-left">

</figure></p>

<p>The moon Triton orbits the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_giant" target="_blank">ice
giant</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> Neptune. It’s the largest
Neptunian moon and along with the Jovian moons Io and Europa, along with the
Saturnian moons Titan and Enceladus, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/06/16/1026473/best-worlds-extraterrestrial-life-solar-system-ranked/" target="_blank">is one of the five geologically active
moons in the solar
system</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-11"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> Triton is
fascinating because it orbits Neptune <em>opposite</em> of Neptune’s orbit (it’s the
largest moon in the solar system to do so) and it might have an ocean
underneath its ice covering. <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-missions/trident-mission-neptune-moon-triton/" target="_blank">This suggests that ocean existed prior to it
being
captured</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
which might make that ocean older than Earth. However, <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/15312/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-to-saturn/" target="_blank">it takes years to get
to
Saturn</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
and the amount of fuel necessary (and the complexity of slowing down once you
reach the planet) limit out ability to look for life. Given that the extreme
cold suggests that life can’t exist, it’s probably a low priority for us.</p>

<h3><a name="ceres"></a>Ceres</h3>

<p>Ceres, orbiting in our asteroid belt, is the largest dwarf planet. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/11/1006447/ceres-largest-asteroid-dwarf-planet-underground-ocean-salty-water/" target="_blank">It might

<a href="https://www.space.com/40934-dwarf-planet-ceres-more-organic-molecules.html" target="_blank">It might also have abundant organic
compounds</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
However, many things unrelated to life are “organic compounds,” so this isn’t
particularly inspiring. If the ocean does exist, we don’t know how it came
about and the data is still unconfirmed. Ceres is interesting and accessible,
but as a candidate for life, it seems poor.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-12"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<h3><a name="europa"></a>Europa</h3>

<p>Yeah, I’ve seen the <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/i/poster/Dive-Europa-Space-Art-by-lynxcollection/41258071.LVTDI" target="_blank">dive
Europa</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
art. This moon of Jupiter is tiny, but it apparently has more water than all
of Earth’s ocean’s combined. <a href="https://geology.com/stories/13/life-on-europa/" target="_blank">It almost certainly has an ocean beneath its ice
crust</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, but I rate it a poor
candidate in the search for life because its constantly getting blasted by
radiation from Jupiter and we’ve seen no biosignatures. The ingredients for
life seem to be there, but I’d rather we focus our attention on worlds which
are giving us hints something is there.</p>

<p>Of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010:_Odyssey_Two" target="_blank">2010: Odyssey
Two</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, by Arthur C. Clarke
contained the warning “ALL THESE WORLDS ARE YOURS – EXCEPT EUROPA.
ATTEMPT NO LANDING THERE.” I’m just the sort of guy who would be tempted to
visit just because I’m told not to.</p>

<h3><a name="ganymede"></a>Ganymede</h3>

<p>The Jovian moon Ganymede, the largest moon in our solar system, is
particularly intriguing because it’s large, it has a subsurface ocean, it has
a magnetic field to ward off Jovian radiation, and appears to have many of
what we think are likely prerequisites for life. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2021/07/28/is-ganymede---not-mars-or-europa---the-best-nearby-place-to-look-for-alien-life/?sh=14b0ca1f41d9" target="_blank">This article by
astrophysicist Ethan Siegel lays out a case for investing Ganymede for
life</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
However, I’m unconvinced for the same reasons as Europa: no biosignatures have
yet been detected.</p>

<h2><a name="interesting-candidates"></a>Interesting Candidates</h2>

<h3><a name="enceladus"></a>Enceladus</h3>

<p><figure class="captioned">
    <img src="/static/images/enceladus.jpg" width="600" alt="Saturn's moon, Enceladus">

</figure></p>

<p>At first glance, Enceladus does not seem like a likely candidate for life as
it’s a small, icy moon of Saturn. However, it’s geologically active, with
cryovolcanoes (they spew water), a subsurface ocean, and probably hot vents in
those oceans. More importantly, <a href="https://www.popsci.com/science/saturn-ocean-moon/" target="_blank">something is pumping out a lot of methane
from that ocean</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2022/03/methane-biosignatures.html" target="_blank">Methane
is considered a
biosignature</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
because it’s usually generated by life (on Earth, of course) and tends to
degrade quickly, meaning that a large amount of methane suggests that
something is replenishing it.</p>

<p>The team that analyzed the methane data studied a geological process known as
<a href="http://jersey.uoregon.edu/~mstrick/AskGeoMan/geoQuerry45.html" target="_blank">serpentinization</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
which could generate methane, but came to the conclusion that it would be
impossible to generate as much methane as was seen. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Investigation_For_Enceladus" target="_blank">A sample return mission
was proposed for
Enceladus</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
but sadly, NASA did not accept the proposal. Enceladus is a wonderful
candidate for sample return because ...</p>

<ul>
<li>Its low gravity makes the mission easier</li>
<li>Methane is a biosignature</li>
<li>The cryovolcanoes spew the samples high enough to easily collect on a flyby</li>
<li>The potential for discovering life makes this a very high reward mission</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll probably have to wait a few decades for the answer to this one, which is
why I was tempted to put it in the “Unlikely Candidate” category (e.g.,
pragmatism).</p>

<h3><a name="venus"></a>Venus</h3>

<p>Venus, despite having a hellish surface, has long been viewed as a candidate
for extraterrestrial life. In 1967, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/2161198a0.epdf?sharing_token=6hkVV0fizhD5pFcPQKejHtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PLG2fvIiRC7fWvVhqds2yTl5hRhPfBTu4FF5X4-GFsbAAGDhzjlmfV3rlisYV_Kx6FQH-Q-YAWTW-VZ989SAwTR3HmgQe-DXo0eToHXNY5Ca8eZ2c3KIR28YCakz5Ke1uiRjlyqCUfTlP5aiZdZbFSrZcbyjj9Tdmem2Fh63dbkw%3D%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=mashable.com" target="_blank">Carl Sagan argued that life was unlikely
on the surface of
Venus</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
However, in the same year, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/venus-life-theory-carl-sagan" target="_blank">he argued that life might exist in the clouds of
Venus</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. We’ve also
found <a href="https://www.space.com/35294-alien-life-venus-mission-concept.html" target="_blank">dark streaks in the Venusian atmosphere that can’t be easily
explained</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
We have no idea what the dark streaks are. We don’t know their origin or
composition. We don’t know why they don’t mix with the rest of the atmosphere
and we don’t know why they absorb ultraviolet light. From the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>However, in a region beginning around 31 miles (50 km) in altitude and
  extending 7.5 miles (12 km) outward is a sweet spot where the temperature
  ranges between 86 degrees F and 158 degrees F (30 degrees C and 70 degrees
  C), and the pressure is similar to that on Earth’s surface. Life could
  potentially survive in this zone where the dark-streaking UV absorber is
  found.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Microbial life could easily explain those dark streaks. Further, we now know
that the unusual Venusian magnetic field is created by an interaction between
the solar wind and <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/NewsStory/210603-Solar-Orbiter-unveils-new-details-Venus-magnetosphere" target="_blank">Venus'
ionosphere</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
Venus' ionosphere starts about 120 kilometers above the ground, so we have a
magnetic field to help protect potential life against cosmic rays. Without
such a field, those rays could sterilize the planet.</p>

<p>But again, aliens? No. There’s probably a non-biological explanation (there
always has been, once it’s found). However, until life is ruled out, Venus is
relatively easy to visit (easier than Mars, actually), and if a sample return
mission could be arranged, it’s worth the effort. Even if we didn’t find life,
the scientific knowledge we would gain would be tremendous.</p>

<p>More exciting is the recent detection of phosphine in the atmosphere.  Since
phosphine is generally produced by life on Earth, and we struggle to describe
any geological process on Venus that could produce phosphine, the news created
a lot of excitement because <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2018.1954" target="_blank">phosphine is a considered to be an excellent
candidate for a biosignature in anoxic (low oxygen)
atmospheres</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. In
particular:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Phosphine is a promising biosignature gas, as it has no known abiotic false
  positives on terrestrial planets from any source that could generate the
  high fluxes required for detection.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Phosphine on Venus would be stunning news, but others have come out to say
<a href="https://www.mpg.de/17209676/0716-aero-no-phosphine-in-venus-clouds-151060-x" target="_blank">there’s no phosphine after
all</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
and others have disputed <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1174-4" target="_blank">the original
research</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> led by <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/913804-greaves-jane" target="_blank">Professor
of Astronomy Jean
Greaves</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and her
team at Cardiff University in Wales. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01423-y" target="_blank">She’s had to post follow-up papers to
explain flaws in some of the objections to her
work</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. The overall
consensus in the popular press seems to be that there no phosphine detected in
the Venus atmosphere and Greaves and her team simply misinterpreted the data.</p>

<p>If Greaves is right, this could be huge news. If she’s wrong, that’s how
science works. However, in what should be a major story, but has largely been
unreported in the press, <a href="https://www.planetary.org/" target="_blank">The Planetary Society</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
has <a href="https://www.planetary.org/planetary-radio/2022-jane-greaves-more-venus-phosphine" target="_blank">published a recent podcast with Professor
Greaves</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
where she announces that <a href="https://www.planetary.org/planetary-radio/2022-jane-greaves-more-venus-phosphine" target="_blank">another telescope has apparently confirmed the
existence of
phosphine</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
meaning two telescopes and at least three different instruments confirming its
existence. This is not proof (and we need more teams than just Greave’s team
reporting this), but it certainly suggests we need to follow this up.</p>

<h3><a name="mars"></a>Mars</h3>

<p><figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/planet-mars.jpg" width="600" alt="The planet Mars.">
    <figcaption>The planet Mars. </figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>If I could only choose one place in the solar system to search for
extraterrestrial life, it would be Mars, hands down. However, my reasoning is
due to some research which, sadly, has been largely ignored. It was research
conducted in the 1970s, but we’ll get back to that.</p>

<p>We now know that Mars was relatively like Earth early in its history, with a
large ocean covering its northern hemisphere and a generally warm climate.
However, due to the lack of a magnetosphere, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aai7721" target="_blank">Mars' atmosphere was stripped
away by the solar
wind</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. With that, it
lost the ability to trap heat and it turned into a cold, apparently lifeless
rock. We don’t know the exact timing, but it may have been about <a href="https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/indian-scientists-find-how-mars-lost-its-atmosphere-952775.html" target="_blank">1 to 1.5
billion years ago that Mars lost its
magnetosphere</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
giving life plenty of time to evolve, given that life was well-established on
Earth at this time.</p>

<p>However, that’s not all. Methane has possibly been detected on Mars, but <a href="https://www.space.com/exomars-orbiter-no-methane-on-mars" target="_blank">the
Trace Gas Orbiter did not find any
methane</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. However,
<a href="https://eos.org/editors-vox/the-mystery-of-methane-on-mars-thickens" target="_blank">some recent studies suggest that there <em>may</em> still be methane produced on
Mars</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> by
unknown sources. The existence of methane on Mars is still highly
controversial, but I consider three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Mars was very Earth-like for billions of years</li>
<li>We might have detected a key biosignature</li>
<li>We are considering colonizing Mars</li>
</ol>

<p>Those three things together make Mars a strong candidate for searching for
life simply because we can do this as a side-effect of other ongoing efforts.</p>

<p>That is not, however, the primary reason we should choose Mars as our primary
candidate in the search for life. Yes, we have a potential biosignature, but
you might remember my biopresentation discussion above. We might have
discovered <em>metabolism</em> on Mars, and that happened back in the 1970s.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://phys.org/news/2016-10-year-old-viking-life-mars.html" target="_blank">this phys.org
article</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1976, two Viking landers became the first US spacecraft from Earth to
  touch down on Mars. They took the first high-resolution images of the
  planet, surveyed the planet’s geographical features, and analyzed the
  geological composition of the atmosphere and surface. Perhaps most
  intriguingly, they also performed experiments that searched for signs of
  microbial life in Martian soil.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the experiment, these two landers, thousands of kilometers apart, each
injected a $C_{14}$-laced (carbon 14) nutrient solution and then examined the
air. They each detected that <em>something</em> had released the $C_{14}$ from the
solution.  They also heated each sample of 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees
Fahrenheit) and repeated the experiment. Each detected significantly reduced
amounts of $C_{14}$, as would be expected if the heat killed off organisms.</p>

<p>Previously, this experiment had been repeated extensively on Earth to verify
that it was indeed a solid indication of life. It was also tested with known
sterile samples to see if some other effect were causing the release of
$C_{14}$.</p>

<p>So in 1976, we had a <em>strong</em> indicator of life, or “biopresenter,” as I like
to think of it. However, there were some problems. The biggest obstacle could
be if some natural chemical process could replicate these results. A type of
salt called “formate” could possibly be responsible, but it’s not thought that
formate is heavily present on Mars. Perchlorate, which we know is heavily
present on Mars, can produce similar results, but it does so even when
heated to above 160 degrees Celsius, so it’s not consistent with what we’ve
seen. Hypochlorite might be present on Mars and it breaks down when heated to
above 160 degrees, but its behavior has not been tested at 50 degrees,<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-13"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span>. It’s currently the best explanation for the observed biopresentation, but
even if the 50 degree test is carried out, that doesn’t rule out microbes on
Mars. Of course, I remind you of the answer to the “aliens?” question. <a href="https://phys.org/news/2016-10-year-old-viking-life-mars.html" target="_blank">Read
the article in full to understand
more</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. It’s a
complex question and there are no clear answers.</p>

<h1><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1>

<p>For Mars, we had suitable conditions that life <em>could</em> have evolved in.
Given the ubiquity of extremophiles on Earth, it’s not a stretch to imagine
ancient Martian life evolving to exist in their current harsh climate. We have
a potential biosignature <em>and</em> a potential biopresenter. Mars is our best bet
for looking for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>However, there are so many other interesting questions here. <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.02050/full" target="_blank">Recent research
bolsters the case for
panspermia</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
so if we discover life on Mars, did it originate on Earth? Or, since we know
Martian meteorites have landed on Earth, are we Martians? I certainly hope
not. I have nothing against the idea of of originating on Mars, but I want to
find <em>many</em> examples of abiogenesis. That would tell us that our universe is
probably filled with life. The more life there is, the more chances for
intelligent life to exist somewhere else. Of course, that brings up the Fermi
Paradox.</p>

<p>With the <a href="/blog/time-to-invest-in-space.html">the new space industry taking
off</a>, it’s a very exciting time to be
alive and exobiologists might turn from biologists who write science fiction
to one of our most important scientific disciplines.</p>
