<h1><a name="a-brief-history-of-private-spaceflight"></a>A Brief History of Private Spaceflight</h1>

<p>At the end of the 20th century, spaceflight was considered a “national”
endeavor, limited to a few countries such as the United States, Russia,
France, China, Japan, and so on. Companies like Boeing, Honeywell, Roscomos,
Arianespace, and others provided space offerings that were attached to
national programs, not private programs.</p>

<p>But at the dawn of the 21st century, things started to change. Jeff Bezos
founded <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/" target="_blank">Blue Origin</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> in 2000. Elon Musk founded
<a href="https://www.spacex.com/" target="_blank">SpaceX</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> in 2002.  Richard Branson founded <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/" target="_blank">Virgin
Galactic</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> in 2004. Blue Origin was in stealth
mode. Elon Musk was laughed at. Virgin Galactic was viewed as the toy of a
billionaire playboy. Bezos, Musk, and Branson, serial entrepreneurs all, saw a
future for spaceflight that others had not. They wanted to create new
industries.</p>

<p>At that time, VCs weren’t interested in space startups. Investment funds
didn’t carry them in their portfolios.  By 2014, when <a href="https://terrabellatech.blogspot.com/2014/06/skybox-imaging-google.html" target="_blank">Google acquired satellite company Skybox
Imaging</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
that changed. The era of private spaceflight was starting to mature.</p>

<p><figure class="captioned">
    <img src="/static/images/otrag-rocket-1970s.jpg" width="600" alt="Fair use via: http://www.astronautix.com/o/otrag.html">
    <figcaption>The OTRAG Rocket, 1977 </figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>But just as many people aren’t aware that the internet started long before the
mid-90s, private spaceflight began long before this century.</p>

<p>Commercial satellite launches began in the 1960s, long before humanity landed
on the moon. <a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/oscar-i-and-amateur-radio-satellites-celebrating-50-years" target="_blank">The first amateur satellite, OSCAR I, was launched in
1961</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
a scant four years after Sputnik, and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/features/telstar.html" target="_blank">the first commercial satellite, Telstar
1, was launched in
1962</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>And then there was OTRAG. OTRAG was a private rocket company founded in 1975
by Lutz Kayser, a German entrepreneur. The intent was to build low-cost
rockets an order of magnitude cheaper than existing rockets. Amazingly, Kayser
succeeded, <a href="http://www.astronautix.com/o/otrag.html" target="_blank">but the history is
tragic</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kayser’s activities made the great powers nervous. The USSR and France were
  not interested in Germany achieving an indigenous long-range rocket activity.
  American rocket makers were not interested in having a low-cost competitor. A
  propaganda campaign began, alleging OTRAG was a cover for German and South
  African nuclear cruise missile development. Crude Soviet-source disinformation
  was eagerly picked up and given credibility by the American mainstream media.
  The government of the Congo, [where OTRAG was launching from], was pressured
  by the Russians to withdraw permission to use the site. OTRAG left the country
  in April 1979.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They relocated to Libya, but the Libyan government seized their rockets in an
attempt to create their own rocket program. Fortunately, without Kayser’s
experience, they failed, and the dream of private spaceflight failed with it.</p>

<p>If Kayser succeeded, we might have our moon base by now. We might be on Mars
already. Instead, we’re still waiting, decades later.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_private_spaceflight" target="_blank">There’s a decent Wikipedia page that sums up the history of private
spaceflight</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
but mostly, the nascent industry sputtered along in fits and starts, usually
followed by bankruptcy.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until the 21st century that the private rocket industry exploded.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<p>Now, everything is changing, but what’s going to change? To understand that,
we have to know a bit about the evolution of markets.</p>

<h1><a name="the-four-phases-of-market-evolution"></a>The Four Phases of Market Evolution</h1>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: much of the following is derived from the work of <a href="https://blog.gardeviance.org/" target="_blank">Simon
Wardley</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, but I’ve adjusted some of the
terminology.</p>

<p>Markets (and new products within them) tend to evolve through four maturity
phases. Each has unique characteristics and should be treated differently.
This is boring for most, but it’s important. These phases are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Novelty Phase</strong>: A new market emerges. Unknown how/if consumers will respond.</li>
<li><strong>Stability Phase</strong>: The new market is stabilizing, but not necessarily mature.
Still experimenting with different approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Commodity Phase</strong>: Robust competition amongst competitors. Less product
differentiation due to market maturity.</li>
<li><strong>Utility Phase</strong>: Market is mature, widespread, very stable, and margins are
thin. New markets are built on top of these.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: the above descriptions are far too brief. For extended
  descriptions, <a href="/articles/when-to-choose-agile.html">I have a brief article which explains them in more detail,
  including
  examples</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For private spaceflight, the “novelty phase” was when entrepreneurs started to
see potential, but it’s very high-risk, high-reward. As first movers, if they
succeed (most did not, of course), they can reap tremendous benefits. This is
why Elon Musk regularly tops the lists of the world’s richest people.</p>

<p>As we move from novelty to stability to commodity to utility, we see risk
gradually decreasing:</p>

<p><figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/market-maturity-risk.jpg" width="600" alt="A chart showing how market risk decreases with maturity.">
    <figcaption>Novel markets are very high-risk. </figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>Why does risk decrease? There are various factors, including customers
becoming more comfortable with the market and having new ideas how they can
utilize the market. But to succeed in this evolution, the products in that
market must be <em>reliable</em>. Would you buy a cell phone that only has service
50% of the time? Probably not.</p>

<p>What this means is that as markets mature, their products become more stable:</p>

<p><figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/market-maturity-stability.jpg" width="600" alt="A chart showing how product stability increases with maturity.">
    <figcaption>Stable markets are very predictable. </figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>Now <a href="https://www.mackinac.org/V2003-30" target="_blank">compare this with air travel</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the industry’s embryonic era, accidents were disturbingly numerous.
  Ironically, 1929, the year of “The Great Crash,” was also one of the most
  crash-ridden in aviation history, with 24 fatal accidents reported. In both
  1928 and 1929, the overall accident rate was about one per every million
  miles flown. In today’s system, an accident rate of that magnitude would
  result in a nearly incomprehensible 7,000 fatal accidents each year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By 2017, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-aviation-safety-idUSKBN1EQ17L" target="_blank">there were no recorded deaths of passengers in commercial passenger
jets</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. In
2019, a National Safety Council’s recent <a href="https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/all-injuries/preventable-death-overview/odds-of-dying/" target="_blank">odds-of-dying
data</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
reports that you have a 1 in 107 chance of dying in a car crash. Airline
passenger? “Too few deaths in 2019 to calculate odds.”</p>

<p>But what about spaceships? Astronaut Chris Hadfield reports that in 1981, you
had a 1 in 9 chance of dying in a space shuttle launch. By 1995, the odds of
dying had already dropped to 1 in 38. Of course, those are per flight, not per
lifetime, but if this trend continues, will we see ourselves in the bizarre
position of seeing our odds of dying on a spaceflight lower than our odds of
dying in a car crash?</p>

</div>

<p>Today, no astronauts have died since <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Columbia-disaster" target="_blank">the 2003 Columbia space shuttle
disaster</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. (Note: <a href="https://astronomy.com/news/2021/06/remembering-the-crew-of-soyuz-11-the-only-astronauts-to-die-in-space" target="_blank">the
last cosmonauts to die in space were in
1971</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>).
Though in one bizarre incident, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/astronaut-drowned-space-due-nasas-poor-communication-report/story?id=22687977" target="_blank">an astronaut almost drowned on a July, 2013
spacewalk</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean spaceflight is suddenly safe, but it’s far safer than it
ever has been.</p>

<h1><a name="spaceflight-is-entering-the-stability-phase"></a>Spaceflight is Entering the Stability Phase</h1>

<p>Long viewed as a novelty, spaceflight is entering the stability phase. It’s
not there yet, but it’s on the verge and SpaceX is leading the way. While the
novelty phase offers higher rewards, its risk level is too high for all but
the most informed (and wealthy) investor. However, when the stability phase is
entered, the market has begun to solidify, the products are becoming trusted,
more investors can understand the market, and the risk has dropped
tremendously. Of course, the reward has dropped, too, but that seems a fair
trade-off.</p>

<p><figure class="captioned-left">
    <img src="/static/images/blue-moon-lander-deflated.jpg" width="600" alt="Blue Origin's Blue Moon lander, deflated.">
    <figcaption>Advanced Blue Origin Lander Prototype. </figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>However, particularly if we’re viewing things through a capitalist lens, it’s
hard to argue that a market is “stabilizing” if there’s only one real
supplier. Blue Origin, despite their recent suborbital tourist flights, <a href="/blog/jeff-bezos-1000-problems.html">is
struggling</a>. Due to poor performance,
<a href="https://www.investors.com/news/spce-stock-buy-now/" target="_blank">investors worry about Virgin
Galactic</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and the new
lawsuit against Richard Branson and Virgin Galactic chairman Chamath
Palihapitiya over <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chamath-palihapitiya-richard-branson-virgin-galactic-lawsuit-sued-insider-information-2022-3" target="_blank">allegedly dumping shares while covering up spaceship
defects</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
is not going to help matters.</p>

<p>Roscomos, the state-owned Russian space company has long struggled financially
and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/putin-slashes-russias-space-budget-and-says-he-expects-better-results/" target="_blank">recently announced steep budget
cuts</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
are not going to help. <a href="https://rusbankrot.ru/en/bankruptcy-and-liquidation/private-russian-space-company-dauria-may-go-bankrupt/" target="_blank">Private Russian spaceflight company Dauria is fighting
bankruptcy</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
French company Arianespace <a href="https://www.spaceintelreport.com/arianespace-reports-30-boost-in-2021-revenue-to-1-4-billion-on-50-more-launches/" target="_blank">reported a 30% increase in 2021
revenue</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
but their lack of reusable rockets and their promised reusable “Prometheus”
engine (to be first launched eight years from when I’m writing) being delayed
means they’re falling further and further behind SpaceX.  Worse, the impending
arrival of Starship means <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/01/ariane-and-europe-fall-farther-behind-spacex/" target="_blank">Arianespace is in serious
trouble</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>So with them not going anywhere, what happens if SpaceX collapses? <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/international/elon-musk-warns-employees-of-potential-spacex-bankruptcy-121120100660_1.html" target="_blank">Elon Musk
has already warned his employees about potential bankruptcy if it can’t speed
up
production</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
(though he later admitted this was unlikely). But I’ve talked to plenty of
people about the space industry and most of them are unaware of the numerous
successful competitors out there.</p>

<p>Virgin One was spun off from Virgin Galactic and shortly after its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/13/22880143/virgin-orbit-launcherone-747-cosmic-girl-air-launch-small-satellites" target="_blank">first
successful launch of seven
satellites</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
announced that <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/01/27/why-virgin-orbit-stock-rocketed-higher-on-thursday/" target="_blank">NASA put them on their short list of satellite launch
providers</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
This doesn’t guarantee they’ll be selected for launches, but the private
sector is watching them. They can’t launch very large satellites, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/virgin-orbit-suddenly-has-a-viable-rocket-so-what-comes-next/" target="_blank">their
launches are only $12 to $15 million per

<h1><a name="starship-changes-everything"></a>Starship Changes Everything</h1>

<p>A few years ago, a friend in Nottingham told me she wanted to spend the
weekend in Ireland, so she bought a plane ticket. When she changed her mind,
she threw away the ticket. It was only £20. No longer the domain of the
wealthy, air travel is for everyone and this is (eventually) coming to space.</p>

<h2><a name="costs"></a>Costs</h2>

<p>For the space shuttle, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/472038d" target="_blank">the average cost per launch for the last decade was
around one billion dollars</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. For
Starship, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-spacex-starship-rocket-update-flight-cost-million-2022-2" target="_blank">Musk expects launch prices of less than ten million within two to
three
years</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
Eventually, he projects those prices could be less than a million dollars a
launch.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-2"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<p>In contrast, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/Concorde" target="_blank">the Concorde’s inaugural 1973 flight from Paris to Rio de
Janeiro</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, roughly 5,700 miles
(9173 km), operating at <a href="https://books.google.fr/books?id=nCjsAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA223&amp;lpg=RA2-PA223&amp;dq=cost+%22per+flight%22+concorde&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BN_R-OUbOF&amp;sig=ACfU3U0YVecR5fUTr8PKSEY2ZOoHrS3OQQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj-tbPSwbj2AhUCZcAKHSczA9oQ6AF6BAgdEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=cost%20%22per%20flight%22%20concorde&amp;f=false" target="_blank">a cost per flight of up to $5.20 per
mile</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
could be looking at just shy of $30,000 for that flight. Adjusted for
inflation, that’s almost $190,000 today. However, the $5.20 figure was for a
1972 estimate. In reality, the Concorde was subject to wild cost overruns, so
a $190,000 flight cost is certainly low.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-3"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<p>That Starship may not be significantly more expensive than a Concorde is
mind-boggling. <a href="https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2022/02/spacex-reusable-rocket-costs-versus-airplanes.html" target="_blank">The fact that Starship might actually cheaper than planes for
long-haul flights is even more
mind-boggling</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>But wait, there’s more! <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/07/10/here-are-the-average-prices-for-boeings-5-major-co.aspx" target="_blank">The cost of building the Boeing
737</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, one of their
least expensive aircraft, is just over $100 million. At the high end,
<a href="https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2020/05/mass-production-rate-and-spacex-starship-costs.html" target="_blank">Starships could cost around $37 million
each</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
but an optimistic mass production rate could drop that price to $5 million
per Starship. This is <em>insane</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="disruption"></a>Disruption</h2>

<p>The lower costs, however, have a knock-on effect for the entire industry.  The
media tends to think of the cost of the launch, but the insanely high launch
costs ripple through the industry. Want to make a lunar lander out of stainless
steel? Too bad. <a href="https://www.aesteiron.com/blog/stainless-steel-vs-titanium.html" target="_blank">Titanium is about 35 times as expensive as stainless

<p>Yes, Starship costs can potentially cost an order of magnitude less per
kilogram. What else does that mean?</p>

<p>It means missions can be run in parallel, not in series.</p>

<p>Think about a string of electric lights. If they’re run in series and one goes
out, they’re all out. If they’re run in parallel and one goes out, the rest
keep working and you can compensate for the missing bulb.</p>

<p>Missions in space today are long series of single points of failure once
launched. Consider a simple (ha!) robotic rover to Mars. It’s been devilishly
hard to land on Mars, so we have to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Design the rover</li>
<li>Order the parts for the rover</li>
<li>Ensure all tolerances are <em>perfect</em> for the rover</li>
<li>Assemble the rover</li>
<li>Test, test, test, and retest the rover</li>
<li>Return to step 2 if the parts aren’t up to snuff</li>
<li>Return to step 1 if the design isn’t up to snuff</li>
<li>Do all of this in a near-sterile environment so we don’t contaminate Mars</li>
<li>Move the rover to the rocket</li>
<li>Have a perfect launch</li>
<li>Wait six to nine months while the rocket heads to Mars</li>
<li>Enter the Martian atmosphere at just the perfect angle</li>
<li>Survive the descent to the surface</li>
<li>Scream in agony as the dust storm covers the solar panels and kills the mission</li>
</ol>

<p>I skipped a few steps in there, but prior to launch, costs are astronomically
high to due having to be <em>perfect</em>, absolutely <em>perfect</em>, because once you
launch, any failure at any single point renders all of the previous work
moot.</p>

<p>With Starship, you could build multiple rovers, with much less costly
materials (weight no longer being the major consideration), lower tolerances
for many of the components, and fly <em>all</em> of them to Mars on multiple launch
for less than the cost of a single rover today. A couple of flights fail?
Fine, you still have a fleet of rovers on Mars. And no, you can’t reduce all
of the tolerances, but by building a fleet, the individual costs can be
lowered as you gain more experience in procurement and assembly.</p>

<p>Heck, the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2021/02/19/how-the-cost-of-perseverance-compares-to-other-mars-missions-infographic/?sh=4291213f1592" target="_blank">Perseverance rover to Mars will have a projected final mission cost
of almost three billion
dollars</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
Musk’s long-term goal is to make <a href="https://www.inverse.com/innovation/spacex-mars-city-codex" target="_blank">a passenger ticket to Mars as low as
$100,000</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>Starship changes everything.</p>

<h1><a name="what-the-future-holds"></a>What the Future Holds</h1>

<p>Just as the internet has proven to be a hugely disruptive force for industry
and society, so will the new space industry. But like the internet, we don’t
know what that impact will be.</p>

<h2><a name="new-industries"></a>New Industries</h2>

<p>As we improve our rocket technologies, many of the new industries are already
on the horizon. Space tourism on rockets and even the ISS have already
happened. But <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/worlds-first-space-hotel-open-2027" target="_blank">space hotels are being actively
planned</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<p>Real-time satellite imaging is widely available, <a href="https://www.starlink.com/" target="_blank">high-speed, low-latency
internet</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> is starting, and Japanese company
<a href="https://astroscale.com/" target="_blank">Astroscale</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> is already planning to remove space
debris and provide <em>on site</em> inspection and maintenance of satellites.
(<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/space-junk-removal-is-not-going-smoothly/" target="_blank">Dealing with the ever-increasing threat of space junk is a serious
problem</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>).</p>

<h2><a name="mining-in-space"></a>Mining in Space</h2>

<p>Of course, no story would be complete without discussing mining. If you are at
all interested in space, you’ve long heard that the world’s first
trillionaires will be space miners. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/06/26/134510/asteroid-mining-bubble-burst-history/" target="_blank">The early space mining companies are
gone</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
because they, like OTRAG, were early adopters who adopted too early. They
generally anticipated that the first space mining would involve mining
extremely valuable ... water.</p>

<p>Yes, water. They were going to sell it to <a href="https://spacenews.com/water-propulsion-technologies-picking-up-steam/" target="_blank">spacecraft using various means of
water
propulsion</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
(seriously, the idea is picking up steam). However, the industry they wanted
to support wasn’t ready to be born, so the space mining companies drowned
(forgive me). But water is going to be a seriously valuable resource in space.
I describe this briefly in <a href="https://youtu.be/UmLwYLSmTSs?t=3014" target="_blank">one of my public
presentations</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> (if the video doesn’t

<blockquote>
  <p>Side note: I’m also a public speaker, so if you want to have me give a talk
  about this, <a href="mailto:curtis.poe@gmail.com?subject=Public%20Speaking">let me know</a>!</p>

<p>But what else might we mine? We are facing a near-term global lithium
shortage, so that would be awesome. But where do we find it? Lithium dissolves
easily in water and is found in salt flat brines like those of Chile, or
<em>pegamites</em>, a type of rock that forms in water-rich magmas. It’s estimated
that the moon may have the same relative amount of lithium as Earth, but
without water, it wouldn’t be concentrated enough to efficiently mine. Mars?
Maybe, but we’re not sure.  Ceres has been speculated as a source of minable
lithium, but we can’t send our mining robots on a hunch. We need to go
<em>prospecting</em> to find what we need and currently, that’s too expensive—until
Starship is fully operational.</p>

<p>The same goes for Rhodium and the other platinum-group metals. Without a
low-cost ability to to prospect space, we can’t send out mining equipment,
much less miners.</p>

<p>But let’s say we find a near-Earth asteroid with the metals we want. The cost,
per load, of those materials needs to be lower than the cost of building our
prospectors, launching, searching, building our mining robots, launching them,
mining the metals, refining the metals on site, and then returning them to
Earth. As it stands now, we can’t meet those costs and even with Starship,
getting them back to Earth is difficult. We can’t use parachutes. Simply
crashing them on our planet will destroy much of it in the atmosphere and
needlessly endanger lives, so they need to be brought back in a rocket. It’s
simply not economically feasible.</p>

<p>More accurately, asteroid mining isn’t economically feasible until we have an
established industry <em>in space</em>. At which point, all of that changes because
we can build, launch, and return in space. That’s much less expensive and we
can use those materials to build out space-industry in a more cost-effective
manner.</p>

<p>Sadly, that’s decades away. But asteroid mining might still be viable.</p>

<p>The moon is regularly hit with asteroids and probably about 20% of those are
metallic. Building stations on the moon and using the materials there might be
worthwhile...and we’re already looking at lunar stations. Thus, we can do
asteroid mining, so long as we’re doing it on the moon.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/moon-s-south-pole-in-nasa-s-landing-sites" target="_blank">The south pole of the moon is a potential site for setting up our
stations</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
It appears to have abundant water and if we send out plenty of robotic
prospectors, finding a location near silicon and platinum deposits would give
us the ability to mine the materials to make solar panels to power our lunar
outposts. But we won’t know until we start prospecting.</p>

<h2><a name="disruptive-uses"></a>Disruptive Uses?</h2>

<p>We’ve already discussed <a href="https://www.starlink.com/" target="_blank">Starlink</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, a
mega-constellation of satellites to bring high-speed, low-latency internet
connections to the entire planet. There are considerable challenges involved,
including <a href="https://www.starlink.com/" target="_blank">efforts to reduce their visibility</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and
not ruin ground-based astronomy.  The long-term goal is to have over 30,000
satellites operational, so effort is being put into ensuring defunct
satellites de-orbit as quickly as possible to mitigate <a href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Operations/Space_debris_assessing_the_risk" target="_blank">the problem with space
debris</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<p>But it’s possible that Musk may be <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2021/09/fossil-fuels-are-dead.html" target="_blank">planning to become a trillionaire by
creating space-based solar power generating
stations</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
These generate nice, clean solar power in space and beam it back to Earth.
Before you think this is just science fiction, <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/china-wants-a-huge-orbital-solar-power-station-in-space" target="_blank">China is already planning on
doing
this</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>,
but unlike SpaceX, they don’t have access to Starship. That being said, the
the long-term benefits outweigh the costs of launching via China’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March_5" target="_blank">Long March
5</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> rocket. China is pushing
forward.</p>

<p>Musk’s path may be less clear because if successful, he threatens the
fossil-fuel industry and they will do everything they can to stop him (unless
he creates a partnership with them, which I doubt). They will be lobbying like
made, citing environmental concerns of the launches (oh, the irony), trying to
find regulatory means of stopping him, and pointing out to politicians all the
jobs their districts stand to lose if these stations are operational. This
seems strange, but we’ve already seen this with Tesla Motors. This will be
OTRAG all over again: political and market forces working hand-in-hand to
block innovation. </p>

<p>There will be other disruptive markets to emerge from this industry sometimes
being referred to as
<a href="https://www.spacetec.partners/markets/newspace/" target="_blank">NewSpace</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, but like <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackswan.asp" target="_blank">Black
Swan events</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, we can’t
predict them in advance, and they will have enormous impacts on markets.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16223-space-elevator-trips-could-be-agonisingly-slow/" target="_blank">space elevators will not be the disruptive
  force</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
  Not only are they probably decades away, but an ascent to space will likely
  take weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1><a name="investing"></a>Investing</h1>

<p>Like OTRAG, early space mining companies died because they were too soon.
Early investors in this “novelty” stage of the market lost a lot of money. Now
that we’re entering the stability phase, investing presents less risk, though
less reward.</p>

<p>Before NewSpace started entering the stability phase, there were few, if any,
VCs or financial services company offering services. Today, there are many of
them. Today, investment giant <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-space" target="_blank">Morgan Stanley is even offering space
investing</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
However, space investing today is mainly in the hands of the wealthy. Sadly,
this is probably a good thing because as if often pointed out by investors,
unless you put in 10,000 hours or more in deep study of NewSpace, you won’t
have the expertise to evaluate investments.</p>

<p>NewSpace can’t do the early internet thing of “throw money at the wall and
hope it sticks.” The amounts of money involved means you have to have an
extremely high chance of a payoff. These companies aren’t investing in new
technologies so much as they’re investing in markets with solid business
plans. This sets this industry apart from the early days of the
<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutch_tulip_bulb_market_bubble.asp" target="_blank">tulipmania</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
Internet Bubble.</p>

<p>Of course, other companies are now getting involved. The highly-regarded
<a href="https://www.isunet.edu/" target="_blank">International Space University</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> (ISU), has a
Master’s Programs in Space Studies and offers a wide variety of professional
courses in different aspects of the space industry.</p>

<h1><a name="be-patient"></a>Be Patient</h1>

<p>We’re at the NewSpace equivalent of the internet in the mid-90s. It’s booming
tremendously, but due to the extremely high costs and high risks, it’s being
approached in a healthier manner than the internet boom. However, we won’t see
internet speeds of advancement. For much of the internet, it was a matter of
building ISPs and connecting people and letting the industry blossom. For
NewSpace, the entire industry needs to be boostrapped, including the core
infrastructure.</p>

<p>It’s not going to impact us directly today–no one is buying a cheap flight to
an orbital hotel–but it’s coming and despite the naysayers, it’s not stopping.
And even if SpaceX unexpectedly goes bankrupt (it won’t), it will still keep
coming. I don’t know if I’ll live long enough for a vacation in space, but my
daughter will. So will your children. So will many of you who read this.</p>

<p>The long-awaited promise of a future in space is finally arriving.</p>
