<p><em><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I do not believe in Marxist socialism; I don’t have a problem
with a social safety net, however.</em></p>

<p>Recently on Facebook—words which often do not bode well—a friend of a friend
was not happy that his personal definition of socialism wasn’t accepted as a
universal definition:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The government owns and controls the means of production; personal property
  is sometimes allowed, but only in the form of consumer goods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because his personal definition wasn’t accepted, he couldn’t create strawmen
arguments to knock down, nor could he meaningfully engage in debate because,
<em>gosh</em>, it was simply unacceptable that the definition he just Googled wasn’t
good enough for the other debate participants.</p>

<p><figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/la-rochelle.jpg" width="600" alt="An old, medieval looking port overlooking a harbor.">
    <figcaption>The Old Port of La Rochelle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rochelle#/media/File:Vieux_Port_De_La_Rochelle_C%C3%B4t%C3%A9_Ville_(223237923).jpeg" target="_blank">Source</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>Except that this definition, for what it’s worth, is the one that is largely
accepted today in the US. Meanwhile, in La Rochelle, a lovely medieval town on
the West coast of France (one in which I used to live), they’re expanding the
harbor to provide better services to billionaire’s super-yachts. It’s
<em>socialists</em> who voted to do so because La Rochelle is undeniably a socialist
town. Turns out the socialists here in France often have no issue with private
property or money, but they strongly object to the abuse of either.</p>

<p>For Americans, it gets even more confusing when self-described “democratic
socialist” Bernie Sanders says “thank God” for capitalism.</p>

</div>

<p>So what gives? Do socialists agree that private property is OK or that it
should be abolished? Can’t have it both ways, can you?</p>

<h1><a name="summary"></a>Summary</h1>

<p>Because, sadly, modern people’s attention spans for reading are short, I’ll
share the definition of socialism now and you can decide if you’ll continue
reading or not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Socialism: a political or economic system that promotes social welfare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s it. And it’s not exclusionary. If we look at the social democracies
known as the Nordic Model, they are very pro-capitalist and promote business
welfare, too.</p>

<p>So how do we get from government controlling the means of production to this
definition? That takes a bit of explaining.</p>

<h1><a name="history"></a>History</h1>

<p>You can’t have a meaningful discussion of the meaning of socialism unless you
understand the origin of the idea. And no, Karl Marx didn’t come up with it.
His most famous work, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital" target="_blank">Das
Kapital</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, was published in 1867,
but it was fifty years earlier, possibly with the publications of work by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Owen" target="_blank">Robert Owen</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, that socialism was
gaining traction. However, you can’t even appreciate <em>this</em> without context.</p>

<p><figure class="captioned">
    <img src="/static/images/adam-smith-the-muir-portrait.jpg" width="600" alt="A painting of Adam Smith">
    <figcaption>Adam Smith <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith#/media/File:Adam_Smith_The_Muir_portrait.jpg" target="_blank">Source</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>In 1776, Adam Smith published <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations" target="_blank">The Wealth of
Nations</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, a book today
regarded as one of the first books describing modern economics. And honestly,
it had to be. The foundations of modern economics are land, labor, and
capital. Historically, land wasn’t freely bought and sold. It was largely held
by nobility who would no more think of selling their ancestral properties than
you would think of selling your parents. The concept of laborers freely
seeking the best possible wage also didn’t exist. In the middle ages, most
people were serfs, tradesmen, clergy, or nobility. Fiefs, lands to which serfs
were tied, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/feudalism" target="_blank">still existed in the 17th
century</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. And utilizing capital to
leverage your wealth to build even more wealth wasn’t really a thing because
modern economic thought was, well, not thought of. In fact, the innovative
possibilities of capital combined with profit-seeking labor is very much a
modern invention.</p>

<p>Adam Smith came along when economies were transitioning from zero-sum
Mercantalism to industrialized capitalism. With the birth of the industrial
revolution in the mid-1700s, we started to see a magnificent growth in
profits. We also saw a magnificent growth in new forms of human misery. In the
paper entitled <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2566252?origin=JSTOR-pdf" target="_blank">Time and Work in 18th-Century
London</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, Hans-Joachim
Voth cites Herman Freudenberger and Gaylord Cummins as arguing that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>annual labor input possibly increased from less than 3,000 to more than
  4,000 hours per adult male between 1750 and 1800.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s up to twice the hours most Americans work today (and Americans tend to
work far more hours than most other developed nations).</p>

    <img src="/static/images/child-labor.jpg" width="600" alt="A young child working in a textile mill">
    <figcaption>Child Labor <a href="https://www.historycrunch.com/child-labor-in-the-industrial-revolution.html#/" target="_blank">Source</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>And frequently those laborers were children. It appears that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/revealed-industrial-revolution-was-powered-by-child-slaves-2041227.html" target="_blank">many children
were effectively slaves during the industrial
revolution</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
And by “slaves”, I mean that with all of the horrifying implications. Robert
Heilbroner, in his famous economic history <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Worldly-Philosophers-Economic-Thinkers-Seventh/dp/068486214X" target="_blank">The Worldly
Philosophers</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Indeed, a recital of the conditions that prevailed in those early days of
  factory labor is so horrendous that it makes a modern reader’s hair stand on
  end. In 1828, The Lion, a radical magazine of the times, published the
  incredible history of Robert Blincoe, one of eighty pauper-children sent off
  to a factory at Lowdham. The boys and girls—they were all about ten years
  old—were whipped day and night, not only for the slightest fault, but to
  stimulate their flagging industry. And compared with a factory at Litton where
  Blincoe was subsequently transferred, conditions at Lowdham were rather
  humane. At Litton the children scrambled with the pigs for the slops in a
  trough; they were kicked and punched and sexually abused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sadly, these accounts of the horrors of child labor during the industrial
revolution are not scarce. Is it any wonder that many people objected to this
new idea of capitalism?</p>

<p>One of the most prominent objectors was the aforementioned Robert Owen. A
highly successful businessman, Owen was aghast at how workers were treated and
decided to buck collective wisdom and create a more humane business. <a href="http://www.robert-owen.com/" target="_blank">In 1799,
he purchased New Lanark Mills </a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Under Robert Owen’s management from 1800 to 1825, the cotton mills and
  village of New Lanark became a model community, in which the drive towards
  progress and prosperity through new technology of the Industrial Revolution
  was tempered by a caring and humane regime. This gained New Lanark an
  international reputation for the social and educational reforms Owen
  implemented. New Lanark had the first Infant School in the world, a creche for
  working mothers, free medical care, and a comprehensive education system for
  children, including evening classes for adults. Children under 10 were not
  allowed to work in the Mill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Heilbroner reports that from 1815 to 1825, there were over 20,000
visitors, including nobility and business owners, all trying to figure out how
this mill had become hugely profitable.</p>

<p>Owen, along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_de_Saint-Simon" target="_blank">Henri de
Saint-Simon</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Fourier" target="_blank">Charles
Fourier</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, and others, formed
what we today call the “Utopian Socialists.” Generally speaking, they were a
reaction to the brutality of the industrial revolution and these thinkers
envisioned better worlds, or utopias, based on decency, kindness, and social
needs. However, with the possible exception of Owen’s direct action in New
Lanark, these were imagined worlds, built on dreams, not evidence.</p>

<p>They were, however, the first socialists, they were all over the map, and they
had little to do with governments controlling the means of production.</p>

<p>In contrast to them were the <a href="https://libcom.org/files/ricardian%20socialists.pdf" target="_blank">Ricardian
Socialists</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. They focused
quite heavily on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value" target="_blank">labor theory of
value</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> which argues that
the value of a good or service is the total amount of labor required to
produce it. Yes, many people think that’s Marxist because Marx was quite fond
of it, but their beloved Adam Smith championed it! In Chapter V of <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3300/3300-0.txt" target="_blank">Wealth of
Nations</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The value of any commodity, therefore, to the person who possesses it, and
  who means not to use or consume it himself, but to exchange it for other
  commodities, is equal to the quantity of labour which it enables him to
  purchase or command. Labour therefore, is the real measure of the exchangeable
  value of all commodities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Ricardian’s (so-called because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo" target="_blank">David
Ricardo</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> also accepted the labor
theory of value and his arguments heavily influenced them) argued that because
value is derived from labor, those who labor deserve the rewards. This is
curious to me because it often implies that managers and owners who supervise
and direct physical labor—often without doing it themselves—are somehow less
valuable, but I digress.</p>

<p>To the Ricardians, labor should reap the rewards of commerce, but is instead
exploited. One of these was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hodgskin" target="_blank">Thomas
Hodgskin</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and the opening
paragraph from Wikipedia sums up many issues quite nicely (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thomas Hodgskin (12 December 1787 – 21 August 1869) was an English socialist
  writer on political economy, critic of capitalism and defender of free trade
  and early trade unions. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, <strong>the term
  socialist included any opponent of capitalism</strong>, at the time defined as a
  construed political system built on privileges for the owners of capital.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For Hodgskin, capitalism was built and maintained to serve the privileged
class. However, he didn’t object to capitalism <em>per se</em>. He objected to what we
might call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crony_capitalism" target="_blank">crony capitalism</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
He didn’t want a world where one prevailed due to government meddling and
backdoor deals; he was, in fact, a Libertarian who loved the market system, but
championed labor. He insisted on the rights of unions to exist and advocate
for workers (because which Libertarian would object to free association?) and
he strongly objected to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking" target="_blank">rent-seeking
behavior</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>. But he was definitely a
capitalist, through and through. And a socialist in that he advocated for the
needs of society, not just the monied class.</p>

<h1><a name="marx"></a>Marx</h1>

<p><figure class="captioned">
    <img src="/static/images/karl-marx.jpg" width="600" alt="A photograph of Karl Marx">
    <figcaption>Karl Marx <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx#/media/File:Karl_Marx_001.jpg" target="_blank">Source</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span></figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>It wasn’t until Karl Marx came along and skewered the Utopian and Ricardian
socialists, that people started thinking of socialism in terms of Marx’s more
specific view. This was, in part, because in The Communist Manifesto and
other writings, Marx and Engels created a more detailed description of, and
argument for, socialism. They both acknowledged the moral considerations of
the Utopian and Ricardian socialists but destroyed them for being fantasies.
<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span> And given that the
Manifesto called for revolution and swayed many people, Marx’s views on
socialism were indelibly etched in people’s minds.</p>

<p>In particular, in <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Manifesto.pdf" target="_blank">The Communist
Manifesto</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
Marx wrote of the Utopian socialists:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By degrees, they sink into the category of the reactionary [or] conservative
  Socialists depicted above, differing from these only by more systematic
  pedantry, and by their fanatical and superstitious belief in the miraculous
  effects of their social science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what of his own views? In the Manifesto, Communism is the result, but
socialism is a necessary step:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have seen above, that the first step in the revolution by the
  working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling
  class to win the battle of democracy. The proletariat will use its
  political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all capital from the
  bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands
  of the State, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling
  class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as
  possible. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that is effectively the definition that many hurl against socialism today:
naïve workers gutting honest, hard-working, private enterprise in favor of an
inefficient nanny state. Or to phrase it in the other extreme: the proletariat
rising up against the bourgeoisie to put power in the hands of the people.</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t buy either definition because a) I don’t see it happening
and b) I can’t help but roll my eyes at those those think the definition of an
ever-evolving word must be set in stone by an essay written 172 years ago,
ignoring all modern thought on the subject.</p>

  <p>Girl meant any young person – “gay girl” meant girl, not lesbian, and
  “knave girl” meant boy – while “man” meant any person, regardless of gender.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The word “girl” was originally gender neutral and arrived in the English
language <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/girl" target="_blank">around 1300 CE</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, but we’re not
certain of its origin.</p>

<p>Or consider that the word “meat”, coming from the Old English <em>maet</em>, <a href="http://etymologynow.blogspot.com/2011/09/etymology-of-meat.html" target="_blank">simply meant
“food”</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span> and
its current definition of “animal flesh” didn’t arrive until the 1300s. </p>

<p>Words, of course, have no intrinsic meaning. When I hear the word “peer”, I
think something like “equal in quality”, but if I’m speaking French, the word
<em>« pire »</em> has the same <em>sound</em> as “peer” but means “worst,” a radically
different meaning. <span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-2"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<p>Words have the meaning we ascribe to them and nothing more. But this causes
many problems if we don’t understand that another’s definition is different
from our own. For example, some people think “meat” only means pork or beef,
leading to ridiculous incidents of vegetarians being served chicken because
they “don’t eat meat.”</p>

<p>So if you have a definition of socialism that doesn’t match my own and we
don’t realize this, it’s very easy to have a confused argument. So what do
people think socialism means today?</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/243362/meaning-socialism-americans-today.aspx" target="_blank">2018 Gallup poll of
Americans</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>:</p>

<table>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>2018</td><td>1949</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Sep 4-12</td><td>Sep 3-8</td></tr>
<tr><td>Equality - equal standing for everybody, all equal in rights, equal in distribution</td><td>23%</td><td>12%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Government ownership or control, government ownership of utilities, everything controlled by the government, state control of business</td><td>17%</td><td>34%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Benefits and services - social services free, medicine for all</td><td>10%</td><td>2%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Modified communism, communism</td><td>6%</td><td>6%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Talking to people, being social, social media, getting along with people</td><td>6%</td><td>--</td></tr>
<tr><td>Restriction of freedom - people told what to do</td><td>3%</td><td>1%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Liberal government - reform government, liberalism in politics</td><td>2%</td><td>1%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cooperative plan</td><td>1%</td><td>1%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Derogatory opinions (non-specific)</td><td>6%</td><td>2%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Other</td><td>8%</td><td>7%</td></tr>
<tr><td>No opinion</td><td>23%</td><td>36%</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It’s interesting to note that “government control” has now slipped to second
place between “equality” and “benefits and services.”</p>

<p>And then we have this lovely New Yorker article discussing <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-many-tangled-american-definitions-of-socialism" target="_blank">how tangled the
definition of socialism
is in America today</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.</p>

<h1><a name="the-nordic-model"></a>The Nordic Model</h1>

<p>Or consider <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/files/5726" target="_blank">the Nordic Model</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>.
The social democracies which have adopted the Nordic model have strongly
embraced globalization, capitalism, <em>and</em> social welfare. While they differ in
varying degrees, key similarities in all of these countries include:</p>

<ul>
<li>a comprehensive welfare state </li>
<li>large-scale investment in human capital, including child care and education</li>
<li>labor market institutions that include strong labor unions and employer associations</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on where you want to draw the line, the countries which follow the
Nordic model are Finland, Denmark, and Sweden, but many include Norway and
Iceland in this group. These countries tend to have strong economies and, most
importantly, <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/happiest-countries-in-the-world" target="_blank">five out of the seven happiest countries in the
world</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>
follow the Nordic model. I don’t believe that is a coincidence.</p>

<p>Given the historical definitions of socialism, I think the social democracy of
the Nordic Model fits quite well.</p>

<h1><a name="types-of-socialism"></a>Types of Socialism</h1>

<p>So now I think we can break socialism down a bit into a few different types.
The following, of course, is by no means exhaustive and in some cases, is a
touch at odds with definitions provided by economists.</p>

<h2><a name="utopian-socliasts"></a>Utopian Socliasts</h2>

<p>Largely a reaction to the brutal industrial revolution capitalism,  the
utopians envisioned perfect societies, all radically different from one
another. They’re generally considered to be naïve.</p>

<h2><a name="ricardian-socialism"></a>Ricardian Socialism</h2>

<p>Also reacting to industrial revolution capitalism, the Ricardians accepted
David Ricardo’s description of the labor theory of value and argued that all
wealth belongs to the laborers. They tended to reject ideas such as rent or
profit, but some, such as Hodgskin, were also capitalists.</p>

<h2><a name="marxist-socialism"></a>Marxist Socialism</h2>

<p>This is what most Americans mean when they say “socialist”, which is curious
because it’s a dying breed in the West (though still somewhat popular here in
France). In short, Marxist socialism is when the government owns the means of
production of goods and services. Marx also called for the abolition of
private property, but not personal property (consumer goods).</p>

<h2><a name="democratic-socialism"></a>Democratic Socialism</h2>

<p>In this model, democracy is paramount, but it’s combined with a drive towards
a socialism closer to the Marxist ideal. There are no countries which
currently follow this model.</p>

<p>This is what Bernie Sanders claims to be, but in reality he fits the social
democrat model better.</p>

<h2><a name="social-democracy"></a>Social Democracy</h2>

<p>I like to think of this as “modern socialism”. There are several strands, but
a key feature of Social Democracy is embracing capitalism while trying to
contain its worst excesses, possibly via nationalization of problematic
industries. Strong social safety nets are a key component of this. However,
this leads us to ...</p>

<h2><a name="social-market-economy"></a>Social Market Economy</h2>

<p>Though not a form of socialism in the classic sense, I feel that it fits the
<em>zeitgeist</em> of feelings on socialism today.</p>

<p>This is what much of Europe has adopted today, including the economic
powerhouse, Germany. It’s similar to Social Democracy, but tends to shy away
from nationalizing industries. Social Market Economies tend to support the
market, but not guide it, and have very strong social safety nets. They also
strive to constantly understand the economy and adjust and adapt, rather than
try to find a one-size-fits-all economic “Theory of Everything.”</p>

<h1><a name="possibilities"></a>Possibilities</h1>

<p>Imagine a world where you don’t go bankrupt because you tripped and broke your
leg. Imagine a world where you don’t have to choose between forgoing college
or decades of crippling student debt. Imagine a world where you’re paid a
living wage as a waiter—or you can get filthy rich building your own business
empire. That’s socialism today.</p>

<p>And an overly simplistic review of the meaning’s evolution over time:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pro-social and sometimes pro-capitalist (Utopian and Ricardian socialists)</li>
<li>Government control of production (Marx)</li>
<li>Pro-social (today)</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, there are still people who will pedantically insist that Marx’s
definition is the “one true socialism”, either because they agree with it or
they wish to attack it. But his definition wasn’t the first, nor will it be
the last. And while economists (and pedants) still cling to Marx, many of us
are looking to the future and see the potential of caring about people as
much as business.</p>
