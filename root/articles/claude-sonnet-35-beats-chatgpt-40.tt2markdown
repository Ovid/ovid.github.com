Short article this time. The new LLM from Anthropic, [Claude Sonnet
3.5](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-5-sonnet), has just dropped and I'm
impressed. It's fast, it's accurate, and the code it produces seems to work more
reliably than ChatGPT 4.0.

Claude immediately built a simple tic-tac-toe game for me as a one-page
JavaScript app. It was fast and worked perfectly the first time. I did, however,
have to update my prompt to make the computer player "think" about its moves.
After that, the game was unwinnable. Then I tried something more ambitious,
building an escape-the-maze game. Claude was very fast, very reliable, and the
code never crashed. I had to prompt it a couple of times to improve gameplay and
at one point, it forgot to increase the number of monsters, but quickly fixed
that when I pointed it out.

Unfortunately, I pay for an OpenAI account, not an Anthropic account, so I
quickly hit its limits on free requests. However, in that time, it was amazingly
fast and accurate.

To "finish" the game, I had to switch back to ChatGPT 4o and it was
night-and-day different. I had to manually fix the orientation of the main
character's mouth and it was _slow_. Very slow. However, it did a decent job of
creating appropriate monsters and nicely handled a bug where sometimes the game
would pause permanently.

Historically, when things like this happen, [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
quickly releases an update of ChatGPT which reclaims the throne. Given how
recently 4o was released, it will be very interesting to see if OpenAI matches
this move. The general opinion around the web seems to be that despite Claude's
limitations (for example, it can't run code), it's one of the fastest, most
reliable GPTs around. [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) has really done a
fine job here.
