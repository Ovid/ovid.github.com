# Introduction

Previously in my attempts [to write a JavaScript game
with AI](/articles/claude-sonnet-35-beats-chatgpt-40.html), I was trying out
Claude 3.5 Sonnet and I was impressed because it was definitely coding better
than ChatGPT 4o. There are rumors that OpenAI will be releasing a new model
next year, but the word in the industry is that newer models seem to be
incremental improvements rather than seismic ones. I'm happy about that because
I want to see more work leveraging what we have (including reducing energy
consumption!) rather than the mad rush to build bigger and better [nuclear
powered AI](https://www.ft.com/content/ed602e09-6c40-4979-aff9-7453ee28406a).

So yesterday, after a frustrating day of trying to make vector databases play
better with Perl, I put that aside a bit and returned to the game. I previously hit
my limit with Claude, but now I'm paying for it (along with ChatGPT and Gemini). I decided
to make the game more useful (it's still awful on mobile). Along the way, I took detours
into ChatGPT and Gemini.

[The game is here](/escape.html), if you want to skip the article.

# This Time, the Game is Fun!

I turned to Claude first. Claude has now become my _go to_ assistant for coding,
writing, and brainstorming. Unfortunately, it's still a bit slow and if you have
long sessions, it gets cranky and limits your access for a while. But still,
when I can use it, it's the best.

So, step-by-step, I started adding various features.

1. Select "Easy," "Medium," and "Hard" difficulty levels
2. Create themes for each level, such as "Forest," or "Ice Cave"
3. One teleport per level, but unused teleports carry over
4. You win if you can reach level 6 (not easy on hard!)
5. Resize the game to fit your browser.

The game was kind of fun before, but now it's a cross between a thinking
game, and a logic puzzle. You can pause with the space bar and try to figure
out if your reflexes are fast enough to sneak past the monsters. The different
themes per level really make the game stand out. I'm enjoying it.

[% INCLUDE include/image.tt
   src      = "/static/images/pacman-bad-eyes.png"
   alt      = 'A pacman-like character with the eye on the rim of the mouth'
   caption  = "The eyes were awful."

It was a pleasant hour or so, adding all of these features and tweaking the game
play, but there was one thing I finally couldn't stand any more. Claude had
never been able to get the eyes right. I decided to tackle that.

It was a frustrating fifteen minutes, with eyes all over the place. I finally
gave up and turned to ChatGPT. Wash, rinse, repeat. This, apparently, is a hard
problem. My goal of writing no code wasn't working. I was about to adjust the
code, when I had a thought. A curious thought. One that rarely turns out well
for me.

I turned to Google's Gemini. I have a paid account there, too. Mainly this is
for the one million token context window and the Google Docs integration. Those
are Gemini's saving grace. Nothing else is good. I knew Gemini would fail, but I
gave it a shot. I uploaded the image, shared the HTML, and wrote the following
prompt:

> For the following game, you'll notice that the eye of the main character is on
> the edge of the mouth. I would like it positioned more naturally in the head.
> I've tried with other LLMs and they either lose the pacman shape altogether,
> or they get the eye outside the head entirely.

Have I mentioned that Gemini is terrible? Yes, it's terrible. So imagine my
shock when I applied it's suggestion and it worked! Unlike Claude and ChatGPT,
it actually moved the eye closer inside the body. I was stunned. This was the
first time that Gemini undeniably did something Claude and ChatGPT couldn't.
Fantastic!

But even though it correctly moved the eye, it was still touching the lip, even
though it wasn't overlapping it. So I issued another prompt:

> That definitely looks better. Can you move it a bit further inside the body?

[And Gemini dutifully replied](https://gemini.google.com/app/eeced9653ed03a4e):

> I'm a text-based AI, and that is outside of my capabilities.

Have I mentioned that Gemini is terrible?

# Conclusion

I'm looking forward to the next release of ChatGPT, but for now, Claude is still
my first choice. Gemini is terrible. That's a shame because Google clearly has
the skills to do amazing things and I love some of the research papers they're
releasing around AIs, particularly their work in reducing hallucinations, but
for now, if you're not using Google Docs, it's just not worth it.
