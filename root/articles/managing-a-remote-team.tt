<p>Note: this is a long article because this is a complex topic. Assembling
and managing remote teams is largely like assembling and managing local teams,
but there are a few differences. Further, though hiring is pretty much the
same, since most people have little formal background in how to conduct a
proper hiring process, I go in-depth in how to do this in a solid fashion
which will gain you the best employees. This will largely be explained via our
process of consulting, but it's appropriate for internal use, too.</p>

<hr>

<p>I was living in Paris a few years ago and I was contacted by an old friend
living in Brighton, England.  Despite exhaustive searching, his company
couldn't find any local developers experienced with Perl, nor could they find
any developers both willing to learn Perl <em>and</em> work on their old,
creaky codebase.  After a bit of discussion, it was pretty clear what the
issues were and what needed to be done to fix them. I've done this enough that I'm
practically genetically engineered for this role and I was contacted because
of my deep experience in this area.[% Ovid.add_footnote('And because the
manager had worked with me before at the BBC and knew what I could do') %] So
when I received the news that they hired a junior programmer with no Perl
experience and who failed their language-agnostic programming test, I was a
bit surprised. He did, however, have a key qualification I lacked.</p>

<figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/borg-ancestors.jpg" width="600" alt="Row after row after row of office workers, sitting at shared desks, working on small laptops.">
    <figcaption>I do not want to work here. [% Ovid.cite('https://unsplash.com/photos/QBpZGqEMsKg', 'Source') %]</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>He was willing to sit in a chair in their offices for eight hours a day. I
was telecommuting. Oh, and he was probably cheaper.[% Ovid.add_footnote("To be
fair, though the company agreed on my rate, they stated from the outset they
wanted me in Brighton regularly.") %]</p>

<p>The situation went about as well as you would suspect and my friend
eventually left the company when it was clear things weren't getting better.
Apparently their junior developer couldn't redesign a decades-old codebase in
a language he didn't know.</p>

<p>So why would a company make such a silly mistake? <strong>Fear</strong>.
Developers often want to [%
Ovid.link('/articles/a-simple-way-to-fix-legacy-code.html', 'rewrite instead
of refactor') %] simply because they don't know how to rebuild a large code
base. Similarly, management often says "no" to remote teams because they don't
know how to manage one.</p>

<p>And I get it. Managing a remote team requires a subtly different skillset
than managing a local team, especially for managing communication. However,
once you learn how to build and manage a remote team, <strong>you have your
pick of of some of the best talent on the planet</strong>. Think about having
a team of top experts at your fingertips to build real value for your company.
This is the real strength of remote teams and this is how you manage them.</p>

<h1>Building a Remote Team</h1>

<p>You can have the greatest management skills on the planet, but if you have
an awful team, you're going to struggle.</p>

<p><strong>Hiring well is the most important thing a company can
do.</strong></p>

<p>Every bad hire is flushing money down the toilet. Every bad hire takes the
place of the person you really wanted. Every bad hire distracts other
employees as they have to pick up the slack. Every bad hire tells other
employees "management doesn't understand."</p>

<p>And so it's worth repeating: <strong>hiring well is the most important
thing a company can do.</strong></p>

<p>That said, we have to identify what you're looking for. What you want in a
remote team is what you want in a local team: a team that can respond to your
needs and <em>cares</em> about success. In fact, most of what I say here will
apply to local teams. Our consulting firm, [%
Ovid.cite('https://allaroundtheworld.fr/', 'All Around the World') %], has a
complete hiring process that focuses on both hard (technical) and soft
(interpersonal) skills.</p>

<h2>Hiring</h2>

<figure class="captioned">
    <img src="/static/images/remote-work.jpg" width="200" alt="A smiling woman, sitting on a bed with her computer, flashin a peace sign.">
    <figcaption>Appropriate Working Conditions [% Ovid.cite('https://www.pexels.com/photo/woman-in-brown-knit-top-1977047/', 'Source') %]</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Our hiring process is in three phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>CV (résumé) review</li>
  <li>Technical test</li>
  <li>Structured interview</li>
</ol>

<h3>The CV</h3>

<p>Many would-be employees get upset that HR departments often use software to
filter based on keywords and phrases, but after years of hiring, sometimes in
recruiting for other companies, I understand why HR firms do that. We don't use such
software, instead choosing to hand-review every CV. But honestly, CVs are
often worthless. First, [%
Ovid.cite('https://www.inc.com/jt-odonnell/staggering-85-of-job-applicants-lying-on-resumes-.html',
'many people lie on their CVs') %]. In fact, as I've seen on a number of
reports, this number appears to be increasing in the past few years.[%
Ovid.add_footnote('In fact, I know of one incident candidate who lied and claimed he
was a famous, but secretive programmer, not realizing that the hiring manager
actually knew the programmer in question.') %] Other CVs are terribly dull,
but have great minds behind them.</p>

<p>Thus, many experienced HR people will tell you: just use the CV to screen
out the obviously unqualified. You need someone with a Java+Hibernate
background? Ignore CVs that don't have Java on them. You can <em>probably</em>
ignore CVs that don't have Hibernate on them. Make sure your ad lists the core
hard skills you really need and if that's not on the CV, ignore it. It's
amazing how many CVs we filter this way.</p>

<p>Also look for duration of their experience. If you need top talent, don't
go with someone who used your core technology on a three-month side
project.</p>

<p>And because CVs are almost useless, that's pretty much all I have to
say.</p>

<h3>The Technical Test</h3>

<figure class="captioned-left">
    <img src="/static/images/chalkboard-test.jpg" width="600"
    alt="A chalkboard with the word 'test' written on it.">
    <figcaption>Don't stress! [%
    Ovid.cite('https://www.pexels.com/photo/board-chalk-chalkboard-exam-459793/',
    'Source') %]</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After we filter the CVs, we then offer candidates a chance to take our
technical test. A technical test must not be Trivial Pursuit! Yes, I happen to know what
the <code>$"</code> and <code>$^V</code> variables are for in Perl. I can
never remember what the <code>$&lt;</code> or <code>$&gt;</code> variables are
for. That's OK, because if trivia is what you're asking about, you'll get
trivial employees. Instead, you're looking for people who can think clearly about
your problem domain. For example, when we're hiring backend software
developers, our technical test is a small program we ask them to write. It
might look roughly like this:</p>

<blockquote>Write web-based software that allows someone to upload the
included CSV file and saves the data into an SQLite database. Assume more CSV
files in a similar format will be uploaded later. Create reports that show
...</blockquote>

<p>There are a few other things, but we give the candidates a week to complete
the test and send us the results. To make sure the test is fair, I take it
myself. The above version of the test took me about two hours to complete the
first draft. Again, candidates get a <em>week</em> to do this and we don't
send them the test until they say they have the time to complete it.</p>

<p>And here's our secret sauce: we tell the candidate that they should return
something they consider "production ready", but we don't tell them what
"production ready" means. Thus, instead of writing to meet our needs, they
tend to show us what they think "production ready" means.</p>

<p>For us, we're looking for well-structured code, with tests and
documentation. We're looking for a properly normalized database[%
Ovid.add_footnote('Sadly, this is very rare because <a
href="/articles/how-databases-can-hurt-your-startup.html">most developers
don&lsquo;t understand databases</a>.')%]. We're going to see if you noticed
the data quality issues in the CSV file. We're going to see if your code is
vulnerable to injection attacks. We're going to see if you've used appropriate
modules. In short, we check many things.[% Ovid.add_footnote("Trivia note for
the Perl developers: in the years I've been administering variants of this
test, I've only had one person submit a modperl solution who passed the test,
but it's not because I'm docking them for using modperl. There's something
about developers stuck in the modperl world that means they badly miss the
other things I'm looking for.") %] and we use a checklist to track our
findings. We usually won't fail you for missing just a couple of items, but
very few developers pass this test.</p>

<p>And in return? The developers get a full code review, including references
of where they can read more information about those areas on which they were
weak. I've been amazed at how many developers we turn down who thank us for
that code review. Many of them have never had one before!</p>
 
<h3>The Structured Interview</h3>

<figure class="captioned">
    <img src="/static/images/outdoors-interview.jpg" width="200" alt="A
    smiling man, sitting sitting in the forest in front of a camera.">
    <figcaption>Not how we conduct interviews. [%
    Ovid.cite('https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-a-man-sitting-in-front-of-a-camera-2531552/', 'Source') %]</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The final part of our individual hiring process is the structured
interview. Very few people make it this far and this is the part where most
hiring processes break down. [%
Ovid.cite('https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/22/why-job-interviews-are-pointless',
'Most interviews are worthless.') %] From the article:</p>

<blockquote>Countless studies show that the unstructured 30-minute interview
is virtually worthless as a predictor of long-term performance by any criteria
that have been examined. You have only slightly more chance of choosing the
better of two employees after a half-hour interview as you would by flipping a
coin.</blockquote>

<p>You may as well just chuck half your CVs in the bin and say "I don't hire
unlucky people."</p>

<p>The alternative is the structured interview. [%
Ovid.cite('http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.218.9107&rep=rep1&type=pdf',
"Here's a choice quote from a meta-analsis of 200 articles and books spanning
80 years") %]:</p>

<blockquote>In the 80-year history of published research on employment
interviewing (dating back to Scott, 1915), few conclusions have been more
widely supported than the idea that structuring the interview enhances
reliability and validity.</blockquote>

<p>The analysis is quite in-depth, but it becomes clear that we go from the
unstructured interview&mdash;well-proven to be almost worthless&mdash;to the structured
interview&mdash;a powerful hiring tool that does an excellent job of helping
you select the candidates who will actually be a great fit.</p>

<p>They actually take a fair amount of time and effort to create, conduct, and
evaluate, but here's the short version.</p>

<p>First, the interview is primarily about assessing soft skills which are
harder to teach, though we do throw in some technical questions to cover
potential gaps in the technical test, based on particular client needs. So you
take stock of what you really need for a candidate to succeed. Our company, [%
Ovid.cite('https://allaroundtheworld.fr/', 'All Around The World')%] starts by
interviewing the client to find out their work environment. Are there tight
deadlines? Do you need to work directly with customers? Do you have to
communicate with non-technical stakeholders? Have you worked with remote
developers before? And so on ...</p>

<p>From there, we assemble a list of open-ended questions that help us to better
understand how the candidate's background fits. For example, in a fast-paced
environment, the candidate might find themselves dealing with tight deadlines,
so we might ask a question like "tell us about a time when you had a tight
deadline and you were concerned you might not be able to deliver on time." And
then you apply STARR.</p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>S</strong>ituation</dt>
    <dd>Describe the problem you faced.</dd>
    <dt><strong>T</strong>ask</dt>
    <dd>Describe your role in addressing the problem.</dd>
    <dt><strong>A</strong>ction</dt>
    <dd>What did you do to address the situation?</dd>
    <dt><strong>R</strong>esult</dt>
    <dd>What was the end result?</dd>
    <dt><strong>R</strong>eflection</dt>
    <dd>Is there anything you would have done differently?</dd>
</dl>

<p>By asking every candidate the same question in the same order, and ensuring
you have covered all of the points of STARR for every question (and taking
careful notes the entire time!), we get a thorough and relatively unbiased
view of the candidate's abilities in relation to the client's needs.</p>

<p>You want to have at least two interviewers for every candidate and
<em>immediately</em> after you're done with the interview, you score the
candidate (we use 1 to 5) for how well they meet the client's needs for each
question. And then you just add up the points.[% Ovid.add_footnote("It's worth
noting that our '1 to 5' scoring might vary per question. Weighting a
particular question heavily might be important if it dominates the client
environment, but don't stress about that too much. An even weighting scale
across all questions is usually fine.") %] It works amazingly well and
produces stellar candidates.</p>

<p>A few points about structured interviews are worth noting. First, they're
not often used simply because most people have never heard of them. Second,
as previously mentioned, they're a time-consuming hiring process, but it's
worth taking more time up front to avoid getting a "dud" employee. Third,
candidates sometimes find it stressful to have you drilling into each question
in such extreme detail, so be aware of that.[% Ovid.add_footnote("Also, it's
much harder for candidates to lie their way through a properly conducted
structured interview because each topic is covered so thoroughly that
they're hard to &quot;BS&quot; your way through them." ) %]</p>

<h3>People Skills</h3>

<p>Please note that throughout the entire hiring process, you're looking for
people with good people skills. A destructive personality wrecks teams. I
don't care how good they are, if they're a jerk, they ruin things for
everyone. They need to communicate easily, be friendly, challenge without
arguing, and generally be pleasant to be around. [%

<h1>Managing a Remote Team</h1>

<figure class="captioned-left">
    <img src="/static/images/gratuitous-cat.jpg" width="600"
    alt="An angry looking cat with crossed paws.">
    <figcaption>Probably not one of our managers. [%
    Ovid.cite('https://www.pexels.com/photo/adorable-angry-animal-animal-portrait-208984/',
    'Source') %]</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now that you know how we hire individuals, how do you create a remote team?
This is where really knowing what needs to be done shines. You need people
with different, but complementary skills. Some people might be brilliant at
front-end while others are brilliant at backend. You might have someone who
can see all possible complications and design a system which can handle all of
them, but have another person who's good at simplifying designs and applying
the "YAGNI" (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principle ruthlessly. Another person
might be very skilled at building tools which just make life easier for other
developers (we like a DevOps person embedded in the teams directly). By having
a wide variety of skills, you get more well-rounded solutions and higher
quality work.</p>

<p>These are people who can put their ego aside and have the willingness to
work together to provide the best solution. And because they have diverse
skill sets, they learn to trust one another when someone else is addressing an
area of their expertise.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> creating a team with diverse skills is even more
important for a remote team. Just because your client says they have a DBA or a
DevOps engineer doesn't mean those people will have time for a new team. They
have other things to do and they may not prioritize you as much as the friends
they work with and know.</p>

<h2>Supporting the Team</h2>

<p>The absolute number one obstacle (and objection) to remote teams is
communication.  Sometimes that quick email someone dashed off misses key
details about a particular task that needs to be done.  Sometimes the employee
gets finished waiting on a task and is asking around for work to do ([%
Ovid.link('/articles/project-management-in-three-numbers.html', 'but see my
"Project Management in Three Numbers" article for a great way to work around
that') %]). And you can't just pop your head over the cubicle wall and say
"hey, Sally, where in the code do we handle authorization?". So your role as a
remote manager is to ensure that everyone always has the information they
need.</p>

<p>This need for extra communication and working very hard on this
communication seems challenging, but we've found that this makes our teams
often more effective than local teams because sometimes local teams make
assumptions about how things are, when our team can't afford to do
that.</p>

<h3>Communication Channels</h3>

<p>One of the beautiful things about remote work is that you skip the office
chatter, the constant interruptions, the need to beg IT services to let you
use a different editor, and so on. I often work with my terminal fullscreen so
I can engage in [%
Ovid.cite('https://medium.com/constraint-drives-creativity/the-6-productivity-strategies-to-integrate-deep-work-into-your-professional-lives-5af06bfab33c',
'deep work') %] on heavily demanding tasks. But when I need to talk to someone
about something, I need to have quick and easy to use communication channels.
And email isn't one of them.</p>

<p>The tools you'll adopt will be different depending on your needs, but IRC,
Slack, Zoom, Google Hangouts, and other tools will all be part of that
arsenal. Whatever you do, ensure that you have at least one <em>visual</em>
means of communication (but don't forget accessibility requirements your team
members may have). It's great to ask a quick question on Slack about which
hashing algorithm you should use, but nothing beats a quick Google Hangout
session for quickly discussing complicated topics.</p>

<h3>Listening</h3>

<figure class="captioned">
    <img src="/static/images/dog-ears.jpg" width="600"
    alt="A basset hound with ears held aloft.">
    <figcaption>Listen and listen <em>hard</em>. [%
    Ovid.cite('https://unsplash.com/photos/SIZ66vF4FKA',
    'Source') %]</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Agile fans like the term [%
Ovid.cite('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership', "servant
leader") %] because it makes it clear that management is there to support the
team getting things done. Managing remote teams reinforces this. When your
team needs you, they need you. Yes, you're setting goals, providing direction,
and often serve as the voice of the business, but when Oliver says "I can't
get QA to test my branch," then you follow up and make it happen because
Oliver's job isn't fighting with QA. When the team says there's a problem,
your job is to clearly identify what's wrong and <em>get it sorted</em>. This
is much like the ScrumMaster role of removing any and all blocks for your
team.</p>

<p>Sometimes management can seem distant or not paying attention—they often
are juggling multiple things at once and this can be distracting. Managing
remote teams cannot be like this. Especially when you have your daily "stand
up" (scare quote explained later), you must be focused and <em>care</em>
what your team is doing.</p>

<h3>Politics</h3>

<p>One issue I've seen about remote teams is that they have a particular
sensitivity to office politics. This may seem counter-intuitive because your
team members aren't standing around the office coffee machine, complaining
that Martin isn't doing his job; they're working. The problem is that they're
often anonymous to other teams.[% Ovid.add_footnote('One of my friends, due to
a misspelling years ago, has a typically male name. Whenever she emails
colleagues, she&lsquo;s direct and businesslike. But when she meets them for
the first time, she often has to deal with their confusion because she&lsquo;s
a very attractive woman. Sometimes the result is funny and sometimes
it&lsquo;s not.') %] You need to build bridges to the other teams and bridges
aren't supported at only one end.</p>

<figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/bridge.jpg" width="600"
    alt="A white bridge over a river.">
    <figcaption>Note how the bridge is cleverly supported on both ends. [%
    Ovid.cite('https://www.pexels.com/photo/architecture-autumn-blue-blue-sky-208684/',
    'Source') %]</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When different groups have
different priorities and there are limited resources (as theirs always are),
it's very easy for local teams to have the "we were here first" attitude. Or
maybe your remote team needs a new database provisioned, but the people
responsible for it don't know who you are and, more importantly, have other
things they need to do.</p>

<p>Your job is to fix this, but it's a delicate task. Yes, you can often go to
senior management and say the work you've contracted to do is stalled
because other teams aren't cooperating. And, especially if you're on a
critical project, senior management will sometimes respond by stepping on the
foreheads of those who aren't helping you.</p>

<p>This exchanges a short-term problem for a long-term one.</p>

<p>Senior management doesn't want to step in every time you're struggling and
this can leave the impression that you can't solve things for yourself.[%
Ovid.add_footnote('Though to be honest, sometimes this is the only approach,
especially if you&lsquo;re remote yourself.') %] As anonymity is a classic
driver of politics—you're not human to them until you meet them—fix that and
other problems will be much easier.</p>

<p>Get to know the other teams and managers, paying special attention to those
you'll be working with. When you have stand-ups, invite representatives of
other teams to your Zoom meeting. If they have remote meetings, offer to be
present, explaining you'd like to learn more, or offer help if need be. When
they need your support, give it to them, too. Are they struggling to figure
out why their PostgreSQL database is running slowly and you happen to have a
PostgreSQL guru on hand? Offer that support if you can. People don't want to
help if they view it as a one-way street.</p>

<p>You are a helpful, friendly, rising tide that lifts all boats. Helping one
another and making sure everyone knows one another helps to minimize politics
quite a bit. But they'll still be there. No matter how important your work,
the work you're not doing is important too. Some other manager might think
you're the greatest thing since sliced bread, but she has a tight deadline and
no, the bug your team identified won't get fixed by the next release.</p>

<p>That's a realistic position, but it gets called "politics." When you let
your team know the bug can't be fixed right now, you're supportive of your
team, but of your client, too. If the team insists on the full story, tell them
the truth, but tell it from the standpoint of the manager who denied the
request. "She would love to help, but she doesn't have the resources to fix
this before the next release."</p>

<p>By doing this, you show support for <em>everyone</em>. You're like Tom
Hanks as Captain John H. Miller in "Saving Private Ryan": you don't grumble or
complain. You support. You build bridges to others and you shield your team
from the mess. They will learn to trust you, they'll reserve their complaints
for critical issues, and they'll have fewer distractions from their work.</p>

<h3>Answer Questions Before They're Asked</h3>

<figure class="captioned-left">
    <img src="/static/images/i-have-a-question.jpg" width="200" alt="A man peeking his head out from behind a curtain.">
    <figcaption>"Psst! I have a question!" [%
    Ovid.cite('https://unsplash.com/photos/vLz1Gy-FLkQ', 'Source') %]</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is one of the hardest skills to develop, but it goes a long way to
ensuring you have a great team. Often your team will say things like "we tried
to extract the data but we can't because the API appears to be inconsistent."
If your answer is "I'll find out immediately what's going on", that's great,
but it means your team is blocked until you come back with more
information.</p>

<p>A better answer is to realize they're dealing with an external resource
and find out who's an expert you can call on right away. Then your answer is
"Damien knows the best about that system and he can provide you with
documentation and answer your questions."</p>

<p>Curiously, non-technical managers are sometimes better at this. A technical
manager might have some experience configuring SNMP for Cisco routers and in a
meeting, might not realize that SNMPv2 is insecure and SNMPv3 is more secure.
The manager may not know anything about the NETCONF alternative and be unaware
that the suggested polling solution doesn't scale with SNMP.</p>

<p>Thus, a technical manager might gloss over details, thinking they
understand (this is not a given, of course), while the experienced
non-technical manager learns to swallow their pride and ask why there's a
mixture of SNMPv2, SNMPv3, and NETCONF solutions being used. Your job is to
listen and listen <em>hard</em> and if you must leave a meeting with
unanswered questions, you have a list of them and will immediately start
tracking them down. Don't make assumptions that "they'll figure this out"
because as a manager, your job is to ensure that you have the answers and the
information flows freely.</p>

<p>This also means not shying away from the pain of a late-night session
reading through documentation and checking it against your notes to ensure
that you haven't made bad assumptions. You're not providing solutions, your
team is, but you are there to guide them and you can't if you're not able to
address their questions immediately.</p>

<p>Remember: one of the greatest obstacles facing remote teams is the
communication flow.</p>

<h2>Daily "Stand Ups"</h2>

<p>The daily stand-up is our biggest change from traditional management
techniques, particularly agile ones.</p>

<p>The name "stand-up" comes from the idea that if you're all standing up and
some team members are starting to lean, the conversation has gone on too long.
Thus, stand-ups are often time-boxed to 15 minutes. This does not work as well
with remote teams.</p>

<p>The idea of a standup is to have every team member answer three short
questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What did I do yesterday?</li>
  <li>What will I do today?</li>
  <li>What blockers do I have?</li>
</ol>

<p>We've found that the 15 minute time-box doesn't work as well with our
"complete communication" style. The reason is simple. When everyone's in the
same room and someone's explaining a technical problem at length, you often
hear the ScrumMaster say "let's take that offline" because it's disrupting the
flow of the meeting.[% Ovid.add_footnote("On a bureaucratic note, I've also
found that longer daily meetings work better when people are sitting and that
often suggests a meeting room. For many organizations, they don't want you
booking a meeting room for an hour a day every day, or you may simply find it
hard to find a meeting room. Thus, the 15 minute stand-up nicely sidesteps a
bureaucratic problem. That's one of the beauties of agile.") %] Except with
remote teams, there's no "offline." You can't turn to the person next to you
and say "hey, let's talk about that problem I had." Even if you do, you're not
fully sharing the information because not everyone hears about it.</p>

<figure class="captioned">
    <img src="/static/images/tightrope.jpg" width="200" alt="A man walking
    across a canyon on a tighrope.">
    <figcaption>Working on code you don't understand. [%
    Ovid.cite('https://unsplash.com/photos/sQIsk1ceA8s', 'Source') %]</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And if someone identifies a blocker, you address it <em>in the
stand-up</em>, you don't "take it offline." Everyone on your team needs to
know you're there for them if they're waiting on a code review, if they can't
figure out what <code>MyCompany::Catalyst::Role::RewritePaths</code> does, or
they have a test failure they can't figure out. Ask for solutions, discuss the
issue, have someone volunteer to look at their code. And if you must, assign
someone to review their pull request. Someone might grumble that they're being
taken away for a code review, but they know their code will be reviewed in a
timely fashion too.</p>

<p>We've found that our stand-ups tend to run about 45 minutes to an hour.
Every day. That takes more time, but when you have a good team, they absorb
more information. Even if they don't remember all of the details about why you
changed your connection pooling software, when it's discussed more in-depth,
they're more likely to remember that it was done and know who to talk to when
they encounter difficulties with it.</p>

<p>We also use stand-ups as a time for chatting and socializing. This is not
the norm, but it's easy to feel isolated when working remotely and this gives
the team a chance to bond, to share stories, and laugh. All work and no play
... well, you know the rest. Being part of a team of friends, and not just
co-workers, is important. When I go to conferences, our employees and
contractors are often there and we take them out to dinner and share war
stories. It's great to build loyalty, but more importantly, it's the right
thing to do.</p>

<p>Note that this suggests a change in your hiring strategy. If candidates on
your Google Hangout are getting fidgety towards the end of a long interview,
that might be a warning sign (or maybe they have another appointment). If you
mention your stand-up approach to candidates and they immediately react with
"stand-ups should not last more than fifteen minutes", that's another warning
sign that agile has become dogma to them rather than a set of guidelines.
You're looking for candidates who are willing to communicate well.  That means
both being able to explain themselves clearly and to listen attentively.</p>

<h1>Building the Product</h1>

<p>Just taking a work specification and working through the bullet points is a
common recipe for disaster for remote teams. Instead, you have to build value;
the software just comes with the territory.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Company</h2>

<p>When we're brought in to a company to help with an issue and have hired our
team, we work hard to understand the business of the company and the problem
they're facing. And then there are other concerns which might impact our
solution. Do we have to address PCI-compliance? Is the company impacted
by GDPR? Does the company have restrictions on the types of software they
allow? And what's the full stack they have available and are we allowed to
offer alternatives, if necessary? Building a real-time reporting system with
heavy writes using a MySQL database using MyISAM tables requires a
substantially different architecture than Oracle 12c.</p>

<p>Once we have that information and can share it with the team, the hard work
begins.</p>

<h2>The Architecture</h2>

<p>[% Ovid.link('/articles/avoid-common-software-project-mistakes.html', "As
I've written before") %], the later in a project that a bug is found, the
more expensive it is to fix. It's easy to fix a leaky sink; it's disastrous to
realize your foundation can't support the weight of your house.</p>

<figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/difficult-architecture.jpg" width="600" alt="A
    confusing image of a curved building.">
    <figcaption>The architecture of hard problems. [%
    Ovid.cite('https://www.pexels.com/photo/modern-building-against-sky-in-city-258164/', 'Source') %]</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So we start with a careful evaluation of the problem, the kinds of data
we're working with, and the resources we have at our disposal. Then we discuss
possible solutions to the problem, with the entire team and their diverse
skills contributing in their various areas of expertise. If possible, it's
great to have a senior person from the company on hand who has deep experience
with the codebase and company and can offer invaluable advice in driving the
architecture.</p>

<p>If the problem is small, this might be a short meeting. If it's large, this
might be a series of meetings. Regardless of the approach, the client must be
able to review the architecture and offer appropriate feedback before signing
off.</p>

<p>After hiring well, a strong architecture and review is the best thing you
can do to reduce bugs and control costs.</p>

<p>Note that unlike code reviews, architecture reviews happen <em>before</em>
implementation.</p>

<h2>Code Reviews</h2>

<p>After the architecture is approved, the implementation begins. How the work
is organized depends on your management style, though I confess that I'm a fan
of [% Ovid.link('/wildagile.html', 'WildAgile') %] and [%
Ovid.link('/project-management-in-three-numbers.html', 'the three-number
business case') %]. Once a team member has a task, they might discuss it
briefly to clarify the requirements, and when they're done working on it, they
submit it for a code review.</p>

<p>After hiring and architecture, this is the third most important thing in
assuring code quality. Even if your code works perfectly and your tests are
passing, tests are not enough. Tests generally don't know when a public method
should be private. Tests often can't point out that you forgot to test edge
cases or that you missed a race condition. And tests certainly can't tell you
that your <em>technically correct</em> code and documentation is nonetheless
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>Thus, code reviews. When we do code reviews, we're checking that the code
is correct, that it's understandable, that it's documented and that it has
appropriate tests. More than half of all of our pull requests are sent back
for more work, but that's normal for a team that is heavily focussed on them.
The larger the pull request, the more likely it is to have some issues.</p>

<p>The combination of a thorough understanding of the problem domain, careful
work on architecture, and deep code reviews means that when issues do arise in
the software, or a change of requirements occurs, there are seldom systemic
issues. This reduces the up-front cost of development and tremendously reduces
maintenance costs.</p>

</a>

<p>When working remotely it's essential that the people you are working with
share the same values. We work hard to find people who excel, are proud of
their work, but can put aside their ego and focus on the client's needs.</p>

<p>For us, the value is to be able to help, to take the client to another
level. We are putting our talent at the service of the client to support their
growth. We are not there for billable hours. We are there for delivering; for
supporting.</p>

<p>Whether you choose us or choose to develop your own remote team, following
these guidelines will give you a superb team that can do things with software
you never had the chance to do before.</p>
