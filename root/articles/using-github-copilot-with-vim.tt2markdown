> Disclaimer: I just found out that because of my contributions to significant
open source projects, I get access to Github Copilot for free. That being said,
even before I realized that, I was using the free trial and I was impressed.

A few years ago, a client contracted with us to build out a system where they'd 
be automating many common tasks their people did.
