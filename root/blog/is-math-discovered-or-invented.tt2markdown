# Philosophical Mathematics

I'm kind of a math nerd in the sense that [I love math](/tags/math.html),[% Ovid.note("As of this writing, one of those pages has an egregious math error that no one has spotted. Proof that no one really reads this blog. I've left the error because I'm curious if anyone will ever spot it.") %] but not in the sense that I'm brilliant at it. I took calculus in my junior year of high school, a full year before my classmates,[% Ovid.note("But for complicated reasons, I was told partway through the year to switch to another class and had to retake calculus in my senior year.") %]. However, like so many of my contemporaries, I have forgotten much of my math. This led to one of my most hilarious job interviews, ever.

# My Hilarious Job Interview

In 2007, I was living in London and job hunting, and a local company known ominously as "the place Perl programmers go to die" was interviewing me. After a short interview, I was giving a programming test. "Write a function that, given a number, finds the prime factors." I had to do this with pencil and paper.

My first question: "Can I assume I have a prime number generator or would you like me to write one?"

The look of shock on the interviewers face was priceless, but he told me I could assume I have one.

So I started writing the function quickly. At one point, I used an array an array to capture the prime factors and then deleted it, replacing it with a hash (a "dictionary", in many other languages). The interviewer corrected me, saying I wanted an array, and I replied that with an array, I would have to count the number of each of the prime factors, but with a hash, I would merely need to increment the values, with the keys being the primes. The interviewer was again, surprised.

After I was done, he desk-checked my solution to verify it. I had quickly, with almost no thought, written the solution, I looked brilliant.

What the interviewer didn't know what was that about a month ago, I was disappointed that I had forgotten most of my math and bought a book to teach it to myself again. About a week prior to the interview, I had written a program, complete with a prime number generator, solve this very problem.

I didn't get a job offer because they wanted to pay me a junior developer salary. This has happened to me more than once.

So I still haven't relearned the math I once knew, but I found myself getting fascinated by mathematical philosophies and how the approach the idea of whether math is "real" or merely a description of real.

# In The Beginning

When we do mathematics, it's easy to forget that we're standing on millennia of philosophical debate. Most of us were taught that math is "just true," but behind every proof lies a question: _what is mathematics?_

Over the last 150 years, mathematicians and philosophers have offered competing answers. Some see math as eternal truth, others as symbol-pushing, others as mental construction, and still others as a pragmatic tool that survives only because it works. Understanding these foundations matters because they shape how we build proofs, interpret results, and even design new mathematics. But first, we need to understand [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato).

Plato lived roughly 400 BCE and to him, math was something to be discovered, not invented. He viewed mathematics as fundamental to understanding reality and knowledge and believed mathematical objects like numbers and geometric forms existed as perfect, eternal Forms in a realm beyond the physical world. These mathematical truths were absolute and unchanging and the concept of a perfect circle or the number 2 existed independently of any physical circles or pairs of objects.

In short, for Plato, math was a weird blend of mysticism and science and for the next 2000 years, that's mostly where math stayed, Yes, we made tremendous advances and there were philosophical differences from Aristotle's realism to Kant's [synthetic a priori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori), but these were largely philosophical debates, not mathematical.

## The Big Three

* **Platonism:** Mathematics describes a timeless abstract reality. Numbers, sets, and functions exist "out there," and mathematicians discover them. This view feels natural — many proofs seem like discoveries — but it raises a big question: *where* is this mathematical universe, and how do we access it?

* **Formalism:** To David Hilbert and his followers, mathematics is a game of symbols. Start with axioms, follow rules, and see what you can derive. This makes math precise and flexible (we can invent new systems at will), but if it's just a game, why does it describe the real world so well?

* **Intuitionism:** L. E. J. Brouwer argued that math is a mental activity. For something to exist mathematically, we must be able to construct it explicitly. Proof by contradiction — so beloved in classical math — is not valid unless it leads to an actual construction. This approach aligns with computation and algorithms but excludes much of mainstream mathematics.

## Beyond the Triad

* **Logicism:** Frege and Russell dreamed of reducing all of math to pure logic. It was a bold project, but Gödel's incompleteness theorems revealed its limits.

* **Set-theoretic Platonism (ZFC):** Today's "working foundation" for most mathematicians. Everything is built from sets. Powerful, but incomplete: questions like the Continuum Hypothesis can't be resolved within it.

* **Structuralism:** Instead of objects, math is about *relations*. The number 2, for example, is just a position in the natural number structure. This view resonates with category theory and modern abstract algebra.

* **Finitism and Constructivism:** More cautious views that reject infinite or circular definitions. They anticipate today's emphasis on computability.

* **Empiricism/Naturalism:** W. V. Quine and Hilary Putnam argued that math doesn't need metaphysical justification — it survives because science can't do without it.

## Why It Matters

You might wonder: isn't this just philosophy? Does it affect actual math? The answer is *yes*. These foundations influence:

* **What counts as a proof.** An intuitionist won't accept a non-constructive proof, while a formalist doesn't care as long as the rules are followed.
* **How we build new fields.** Set theory, category theory, and constructive type theory all stem from these debates.
* **How math connects to computers and science.** Constructive philosophies align with algorithms, while empiricism connects math to physics and engineering.

The result is not just an academic quarrel, but a living set of options that shape mathematics itself.

## Do Mathematicians Actually Care About This?

Most mathematicians don't spend their days debating whether they're Platonists or Formalists. In practice, they adopt a kind of *pragmatic Platonism*: treating numbers, sets, and functions as if they exist "out there" and using the standard toolkit without worrying too much about metaphysics.

But the foundations aren't just idle philosophy. They matter in three key moments:

* **When crises arise.** At the turn of the 20th century, paradoxes in set theory forced Hilbert, Brouwer, and Russell to rethink the entire basis of mathematics.
* **When new frameworks are born.** Category theory, constructive type theory, and other modern tools grew out of foundational debates — and now drive progress in algebra, logic, and computer science.
* **When limits are exposed.** Independence results (like the Continuum Hypothesis) raise the question of whether some problems are even meaningful, depending on your stance.

So while most mathematicians can happily ignore these questions day-to-day, the **edges of mathematics** — where paradoxes and new ideas appear — are shaped by the foundational soil beneath.

## Closing Thought

Mathematics is more than theorems and equations. It is also a philosophy about what counts as truth, what exists, and what it means to prove something. By mapping its foundations, we see not just the history of ideas, but the ongoing choices that continue to shape how we do math today.
