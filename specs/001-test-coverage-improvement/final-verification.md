### Documentation Deliverables

- [X] `baseline-coverage.md` - Initial metrics before improvements
- [X] `usage-analysis-results.md` - Analysis of all 15 modules
- [X] `unused-code-decisions.md` - Documentation of unused code findings
- [X] `quickstart.md` - Updated with actual implementation workflow
- [X] `coverage-badge.svg` - Visual badge showing 93.3% coverage

- [X] `Makefile` - Make targets for test and coverage commands

### New Infrastructure

1. **Usage Analysis Tool**: `bin/analyze-usage`
   - CLI with --module, --output, --format options
   - JSON and text output formats
   - Subroutine usage frequency tracking
   - Workspace-wide call site detection

2. **Build System**: `Makefile`
   - `make test` - Run test suite
   - `make cover` - Generate coverage reports
   - `make clean` - Remove coverage artifacts
   - `make help` - Display available targets

3. **Test Fixtures**: `t/fixtures/`
   - SQLite test database
   - Shared test data structures
   - Integration test scenarios

4. **Integration Tests**: `t/integration/`
   - End-to-end validation
   - Foundation verification tests

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Test execution | < 60s | 4.6s | ✅ 92% faster |
| Coverage generation | < 2min | ~30s | ✅ 75% faster |
| Total test count | N/A | 816 | ℹ️ |
| Test files | N/A | 17 | ℹ️ |
| Coverage report size | N/A | 15 KB | ℹ️ |

### Success Criteria Validation

From spec.md User Story 2 (Core Feature):

| Criterion | Target | Actual | Status |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| All modules ≥ 90% stmt | 15/15 modules | 15/15 modules | ✅ PASS |
| Average coverage | ≥ 92% | 93.3% | ✅ PASS |
| Test execution time | < 60s | 4.6s | ✅ PASS |
| Coverage regeneration | < 2min | ~30s | ✅ PASS |
| Consistent test framework | Test::Most | Test::Most | ✅ PASS |

### Known Limitations & Exceptions

1. **Template/Plugin/Ovid.pm** (95.8% statement)
   - Remaining 4.2% are error handlers for Template Toolkit edge cases
   - Documented in source with TODO comments

2. **Text/Markdown/Blog.pm** (92.5% statement)
   - Remaining 7.5% are platform-specific regex edge cases
   - Justified as untestable without specific Unicode inputs

3. **Branch Coverage** (73.7% overall)
   - Some ternary operators and optional parameters hard to test
   - All critical paths covered
   - Non-critical branches documented

4. **Pod Coverage** (44.2%)
   - Out of scope for this feature (documentation-focused)
   - Could be addressed in future feature

### Quality Gates Passed

✅ All tests pass (816/816)  
✅ No test failures or warnings  
✅ Code formatted with perltidy  
✅ Coverage exceeds all thresholds  
✅ Performance within targets  
✅ Production data protected  
✅ Constitution compliant  
✅ Documentation complete  

### Recommendations for Maintenance

1. **Monitor Coverage**: Run `make cover` weekly
2. **CI Integration**: Implement GitHub Actions workflow from ci-integration.md
3. **Coverage Regression**: Alert if any module drops below 85%
4. **New Code Standard**: Require 90%+ coverage for new modules
5. **Review Cadence**: Monthly review of coverage exceptions
6. **Badge Updates**: Regenerate coverage badge after significant changes

### Next Steps

1. ✅ All Phase 4 tasks complete
2. ⏳ Commit final documentation (T139)
3. ✅ Constitution compliance verified
4. 🎯 Ready for feature sign-off
