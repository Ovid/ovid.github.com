# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix UTF-8 Warnings in Single File Rebuild

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

**Validation Details**:
- Technical Context section provides necessary background without prescribing implementation
- All success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "zero UTF-8-related warnings", "UTF-8 characters appear correctly")
- Edge cases address boundary conditions appropriately
- Constraints section clearly identifies limitations without implementation details
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - the issue is well-understood from the error messages provided
