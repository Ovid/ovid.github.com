# Feature Specification: Blogdown Live Editor

**Feature Branch**: `006-blogdown-live-editor`
**Created**: 2025-11-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "launch a Dancer2 interface that allows me to write in a web input my 'blogdown' for the current article or blog I'm writing (identified via the last sqitch migration) and use something like bin/rebuild --file <current file> to easily let me preview what I'm building."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-11-18
- Q: How is the file identified? → A: Explicit CLI argument (`launch <path>`).
- Q: How is the preview triggered? → A: Manual "Refresh Preview" button.
- Q: Web framework preference? → A: Dancer2 (explicit user choice).
- Q: Network binding? → A: Localhost only (127.0.0.1).
- Q: Save strategy? → A: Auto-save to disk (debounced ~1s) to support preview.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Launch Editor and Preview Content (Priority: P1)

As a content author, I want to launch a web-based editor by specifying a file path so that I can write and preview my content in real-time.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition—reducing friction in the writing process by providing immediate visual feedback.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the launch command with a filename and verifying that the web interface opens with the correct file content and displays a rendered preview.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid file path to an article, **When** I run the editor launch command, **Then** the web interface opens with that article's content loaded in the text area.
2. **Given** the editor is open, **When** I type in the text area, **Then** the preview pane updates to show the rendered HTML (either live or on demand).
3. **Given** I am working on a blog post (not an article), **When** I launch the editor with its path, **Then** it correctly loads the blog post file.

### User Story 2 - Save Changes to Disk (Priority: P1)

As a content author, I want my edits in the web interface to be automatically saved back to the source file on disk so that my work is persisted without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: Essential for the tool to be useful; without saving, it's just a playground.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making edits in the web UI, waiting for the debounce period, and verifying the file content on disk matches the edits.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have made changes in the editor, **When** I stop typing for a short period (e.g., 1 second), **Then** the corresponding file on the filesystem is automatically updated with the new content.
2. **Given** the file is updated, **When** I reload the editor, **Then** the new content is preserved.

### User Story 3 - Accurate Preview via Rebuild Logic (Priority: P2)

As a content author, I want the preview to use the actual site build logic so that I can be confident the preview matches what will be published.

**Why this priority**: Ensures "what you see is what you get" accuracy, preventing layout surprises after deployment.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by comparing the HTML in the preview pane with the HTML generated by running the standard build command manually.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the editor is running, **When** the preview is generated, **Then** it uses the same template processing and markdown conversion as the main build system.
2. **Given** I use custom blogdown features (e.g., collapsible sections), **When** I view the preview, **Then** they render correctly.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when there are no change records? (Should display an error or ask for a file)
- What happens when the file associated with the record doesn't exist? (Should handle gracefully)
- What happens if the content has syntax errors? (Should display error in preview)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a CLI command to launch a local web server.
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept a file path argument to identify the content to be edited.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a web interface with a split-screen view (or similar): one pane for editing Markdown/Blogdown, one for HTML preview.
- **FR-004**: System MUST implement a capability to generate HTML for a single file without rebuilding the entire site.
- **FR-005**: The web interface MUST automatically save content to the source file after a short debounce period (e.g., 1 second) of inactivity.
- **FR-006**: The preview generation MUST use the project's existing template and markdown configuration to ensure fidelity.
- **FR-007**: System MUST support both "article" and "blog" content types.
- **FR-008**: The preview MUST be triggered manually by the user (e.g., "Refresh" button) to avoid performance issues.
- **FR-009**: The web server MUST bind only to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) for security.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Source File**: The `.md` or `.txt` file containing the raw content (Blogdown).
- **Change Record**: Used to determine the context of the current work.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

- **SC-001**: User can launch the editor with a single command and have the correct file loaded 100% of the time (assuming valid path provided).
- **SC-002**: Preview renders within 2 seconds of a change/save.
- **SC-003**: Saved files are bit-for-bit identical to what would be written if edited manually (preserving encoding, etc.).
- **SC-004**: The preview HTML matches the production build HTML for the content body.

## Assumptions

- The local web server will be implemented using **Dancer2**.
- The "standard build command" refers to `bin/rebuild`.
- The build system can be refactored or invoked to process a single file string.
