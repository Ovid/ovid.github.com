<h1><a name="preface"></a>Preface</h1>

<p>Some of you may be familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistair_Cockburn" target="_blank">Alistair
Cockburn</a> <span class="fa fa-external-link fa_custom"></span>, one of the founders of the modern agile movement. I recently had
a brief email discussion with him regarding WildAgile. After reading this
article, he replied (and I’m quoting with permission):</p>

<blockquote>I think you should continue with what you’re doing, and get more
companies to go along, that will be really great for the world.</blockquote>

<p>WildAgile is an attempt to return agile to its agile roots. So let’s get
started.</p>

<h1><a name="the-problem"></a>The Problem</h1>

<p>I’ve worked with a variety of successful companies, many of which are Agile
in nature, but when discussion of Agile arises, the conversation often goes
like this:</p>

<blockquote>Them: We’re agile.<br>
<br>
Me: Ah! Do you use Scrum, XP, something else?<br>
<br>
Them (embarrassed): Um, er, we just sort of get things
done.</blockquote>

<p>And they do! And yet they’re embarrassed by the lack of a name for what they
actually do. I often hear something like “we do a modified scrum”, meaning
they have sprints and stand ups and that’s about it.</p>

<p>Thus, I developed <strong>WildAgile</strong>, an Agile methodology that is
so agile that it describes what <em>actually happens in the wild</em> instead
of what you are supposed to do. It’s designed for very rapid delivery, with
<strong>Just Enough Process</strong> to provide order to the chaos. Though I
draw inspiration from Scrum, XP, Kanban and Crystal Clear, there’s a good
chance that claiming your team is WildAgile-compliant merely involves reading
this and saying “yup, we’re WildAgile-compliant.”</p>

<p>All <strong>bolded</strong> terms are explained in the description and also
in a short glossary near the end. There aren’t many bolded terms because I
focus on process, not terminology. The “WildAgile Roles” and “WildAgile
Process” sections are all you really need to read to understand WildAgile.
Everything else is just providing the rationale. This documentation of
WildAgile is released under the <a title="Creative Commons Attribution 2.5

description</a> for details.</p>

<h2><a name="background"></a>Background</h2>

<p>When teams transition into an Agile environment, the changes can be
intimidating. XP practitioners regularly complain about pair programming (and
hence don’t do it). Scrum practitioners often ignore retrospectives. System
administrators get upset about a “failed sprint” because they had to stop all
work to fix a critical security issue.</p>

<p>And yet work still gets done. Developers finish a task and take a new task.
Wash, rinse, repeat. By formalizing this I introduce Just Enough Process to
get things done in a structured manner. “Just Enough Process” is an appropriate
tagline for management. “Shut Up And Write Some Code” is an appropriate tagline
for developers.</p>

<h2><a name="what-is-wildagile"></a>What is WildAgile?</h2>

<p>WildAgile is appropriate for small teams where the entire code base can be
roughly understood by a single programmer. That doesn’t mean that someone
points to a given library and the developer knows how it’s coded, or exactly
what it does, but the developer should at least have a <em>sense</em> of what
it’s for. Because WildAgile is designed to avoid <a title="Code that will be
unmaintainable if the developer is hit by a bus"
href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HitByBus" target="_blank">bus-sensitive code</a>,
this might be better for small to medium sized codebases, though I know of a
huge company, with a codebase exceeding one million lines, which is very
profitable and follows a process not quite unlike WildAgile, despite having
hundreds of developers. What this means is that as a developer transitions
from <strong>Apprentice</strong> to <strong>Veteran</strong> (described
later), they won’t always know how to solve a problem, but they’ll know where
to look to solve that problem.</p>

<p>You may think of WildAgile as a <em>transitional</em> methodology. This
means that you may adopt WildAgile before your team transitions to a more
formal method (it’s particularly well-suited as a transition to Scrum), but
many teams find that WildAgile is all they need.</p>

<h2><a name="benefits-of-wildagile"></a>Benefits of WildAgile</h2>

<ul>
    <li>High morale: developers can focus on getting stuff done.</li>
    <li>Rapid development: developers can focus on getting stuff done.</li>
    <li>Ease of implementation: developers can focus on getting stuff done.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may notice a theme in this.</p>

<p>That being said, WildAgile is not without its risks. These will be discussed
on an ad hoc basis as I discuss its components. However, I do not recommend
WildAgile when a potential for real harm occurs. For example, I probably would
not use WildAgile to design guidance systems for planes or medical radiology
software. I also do not recommend WildAgile for highly complex projects in
which the majority of developers cannot understand how various components fit
together.</p>

<h2><a name="the-workflow"></a>The Workflow</h2>

<p>Just to make it clear what I’m focusing on, here’s the development
workflow for one company I’ve worked with:</p>

<p><figure class="image">
    <img src="/static/images/workflow.png" width="600" alt="Complicated
    flowchart showing the workflow one company has adopted for every task
    that need to be completed.">
    <figcaption>Everyone ignored this and still got work done.</figcaption>
</figure></p>

<p>Every task is expected to follow that process. If you have to break a task
into new tasks, you’re still expected to follow that process for every subtask.
Developers in this company regularly ignore this workflow and still get things
done, but management gets frustrated because they can’t see the exact step that
every task is at.<span aria-label="Open Footnote" class="open-dialog" id="open-dialog-1"> <i class="fa fa-clipboard fa_custom"></i> </span></p>

<p>WildAgile strives to implement the following workflow:</p>

<p><img class="alignCenter" alt="A simple workflow with just a start node and
a finish node."
src="static/images/start_finish-209x300.png" width="209" height="300"/></p>

<p>Things are not this simple in the real world, but I strongly advise clients
to understand the Platonic Ideal of Agile and constantly strive towards
it.</p>

<h2><a name="assumptions-made-in-creating-wildagile"></a>Assumptions Made in Creating WildAgile</h2>

<p><strong></strong>Drawing on work from Alistair Cockburn’s <a title="Crystal
Clear PDF"
href="http://users.dcc.uchile.cl/~nbaloian/cc1001-03/ejercicios/crystalclearV5d.pdf"
target="_blank">Crystal Clear</a> methodology, I assume that the following
three requirements are the most important in developing high-quality
products.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Easy and regular team communication</li>
    <li>Rapid delivery</li>
    <li>Expert customer access</li>
</ol>

<p>Many experienced individuals feel that if these three requirements are met,
a positive-feedback loop is created which allows the team to rapidly build and
improve upon products. Any obstacles to these three requirements being met are
detrimental to the productivity of any WildAgile-compliant team.</p>

<p>I am also a firm believer in the Pareto Rule: 80% of your benefits will
stem from 20% of your actions. WildAgile attempts to implement that 20% of
actions that give you majority of benefits of Agile. In fact, I’ve found that
for many smaller teams, attempting to implement the other 80% of actions may
actually be detrimental as you spend more time fighting process instead of
developing software. This is due to a fundamental tension in many Agile
methodologies: it’s an attempt to <em>create</em> processes that are designed
to <em>minimize</em> process. It’s a delicate balance that is easy to get
wrong.</p>

<p>Cockburn’s (pronounced <em>coe-burn</em>, if you’re curious) team
requirement actually said “colocation” of the team, requiring team members to
be physically near each other. This ignores today’s reality. Savvy companies
realize they have access to an entire world of developers if they are willing
to have remote workers.  Thus, tools such as Slack, Google Hangouts, Skype,
Zoom, and other communication channels should be employed to ensure that
someone is always available to help. I’ve seen WildAgile work in teams that
are also temporally diverse (separated by many time zones), but this does
introduce challenges that require extra attention to team communication.</p>

<p>Note: if you don’t have much experience with remote teams, please read my
<a href="/articles/managing-a-remote-team.html">Managing a Remote
Team</a> article.</p>

<h1><a name="the-details"></a>The Details</h1>

<p>Yeah, yeah. That’s enough blathering. What’s it all about?</p>

<h2><a name="wildagile-roles"></a>WildAgile Roles</h2>

<p>There are only three roles defined in WildAgile.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Developer</li>
    <li>Team Lead</li>
    <li>Product Owner</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Developers</strong>, of course, develop the product. They take
<strong>tasks</strong>, finish them, and then take new tasks.</p>

<p>The <strong>Team Lead</strong> (often shortened to “Lead”) is also a
developer. The Lead is also the expert who knows the entire system and can be
relied upon to answer questions and provide excellent feedback. Developers
decide how they’re going to implement something, but if there is a problem, the
Lead has final say. The Lead should defer to the Developer whenever possible
and offer constructive advice when appropriate. Team Leads support, not
direct.</p>

<p>The <strong>Product Owner</strong> (<strong>PO</strong>), similar to Scrum,
maintains the product <strong>backlog</strong>. However, there is no “sprint
backlog” because there are no sprints. The PO is responsible for knowing the
full backlog and being able to answer any business question related to them.
It’s preferred if the PO can also answer technical questions as well, but I
realize that it’s often hard to find someone who is both a business expert and
a technical expert. Thus, the PO focuses on business excellence and the Team
Lead focuses on technical excellence.</p>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> if you’re new at this and you’re overwhelmed by
prioritizing the product backlog, <a href="/articles/project-management-in-three-numbers.html">read my
article “Project Management in Three Numbers”</a>. It makes this much
easier.</em></p>

<p>Additionally, the PO serves as the proxy for the customer. They are the
“expert customer” that you should be able to rely on at all times to answer
questions about the product. The PO is encouraged to practice an embedded
anthropology approach to knowing their customers. This means that they should
use the product, but also work directly with real customers (both new and
existing) to understand customer needs and desires.</p>

<p>As an aside, the customer should always be referred to as “the customer” and
<em>never</em> as “the user.” In English, the word “user” can have a negative
connotation and in our experience it is often used in a condescending manner.
Customers are people too.</p>

<h2><a name="wildagile-process"></a>WildAgile Process</h2>

<p>Every day, a 15-minute time-boxed <strong>stand up</strong> is held. It’s
recommended to be at the end of the day to ensure that what you did is fresh in
your mind, but this is not a requirement. The stand up begins with the
<strong>Summary</strong>. Before the stand up, the product owner should briefly
discuss where you’ve been and where you are going. Any interesting future
issues for the team should be mentioned at this time. The benefit of the
Summary is that it helps remind developers of the context of their work and
better understand upcoming priorities. This makes it easier to choose
appropriate tasks.</p>

<p>After the Summary, each team member should explain:</p>

<ul>
    <li>What they did today</li>
    <li>What they’ll do tomorrow</li>
    <li>Any blockers they have</li>
</ul>

<p>On a daily basis, every team member is allowed, even encouraged, to improve
the code base. Add a Makefile target to rebuild the project. Factor out common
code. Move test data into fixtures. The developer is expected to mention this
in the stand up and it is the responsibility of the Team Lead and the PO to
rein in developers who spend too much time “improving” instead of “developing”
(and vice versa!).</p>

<p><strong>Tasks</strong> are “things a developer can do.” Every task is done
in a separate branch (when appropriate) and when it is done and the tests pass,
it is merged back into the “master”, “trunk”, or “integration” branch, or
whatever you call it. Tasks are expected to include tests, when feasible, and
if merging the code breaks any test, the developer responsible for merging the
code should be the person responsible for fixing the tests (again, when
feasible). Details about how to manage source control are left to the team.</p>

<p>Tasks should be as short as possible. Any task expected to take over a
certain amount of time (a week is a good limit) should, if possible, be broken
down into smaller tasks, each of which can add value even if the overall task
is cancelled.</p>

<p>When a task is finished, the developer independently chooses their next
task, keeping in mind the context provided by the last Summary. They should
prioritize tasks assigned to them, high value tasks, and quick tasks. It is the
responsibility of the Team Lead and PO to guide developers to suitable tasks if
the team member is regularly making poor choices on their next task.</p>

<p>If enough open tasks are open, it is the <em>optional</em> responsibility of
the PO to designate <strong>Priority</strong> tasks. If a new task is to be
chosen, they should be chosen from Priority tasks. If a team member is
unconvinced of their ability to accomplish any Priority tasks, they should
speak to the Team Lead for guidance.</p>

<p>Obviously, if a <strong>critical issue</strong> arises, any task can be
stopped and the Team Lead can assign someone to tackle the issue. There is no
formal structure to this because WildAgile is designed to be as lightweight as
possible.</p>

<p>New team members (<strong>Apprentices</strong>) are initially encouraged to
focus on a single area to become very comfortable with the business rules.
After the Team Lead and PO agree that the developer has become comfortable in
their area, they become <strong>Veterans</strong>. Veterans are strongly
encouraged to regularly choose tasks in areas of the code base they have less
experience with. If Veterans do not regularly work on different areas of the
code, they may find themselves focusing on a small subset of the code base. Not
only does this limit the Veteran’s ability to contribute to the code base, it
encourages other developers to not work on areas of the code that it’s assumed
the Veteran will work on. It is the responsibility of the Team Lead and the PO
to ensure that Veterans are regularly choosing tasks outside of their area of
expertise in order to spread knowledge of the system.</p>

<p>Team Leads and POs do not promote Apprentices to Veterans until the Apprentice:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Appears to understand the business (not the code base!)</li>
    <li>Is writing solid code</li>
    <li>Is writing appropriate tests</li>
</ul>

<p>Releases are not described in the WildAgile process, but it’s suitable for
both continuous deployment and regular releases (as one might expect from a
sprint or iteration).</p>

<p>Note that in our experience, Apprentices get promoted to Veterans fairly quickly
and in established teams, you generally only have Veterans, thus reducing the
distinction between the two.</p>

<h2><a name="wildagile-remote-teams"></a>WildAgile Remote Teams</h2>

<p>Many companies are discovering the competitive advantage of having remote
workers:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You have access to a much wider pool of developers.</li>
    <li>You don’t need to pay for office space.</li>
    <li>Developer salaries are easier to control.</li>
</ul>

<p>That last point is what is driving much of this and is causing some
industry disruption. When you realize that your $150K a year developer can be
had for $30K, that opens up possibilities you may not have had before,
particularly when you find that expert you couldn’t find locally.</p>

<p>However, companies often feel uncomfortable with remote workers because
they’re less used to this. WildAgile works well with remote workers, but a key
change needs to be made: stand ups.</p>

<p>For colocated teams, time-boxing a stand up to 15 minutes works well
because if there are issues later, a developer can simply walk over to someone
and ask. That doesn’t work with remote workers. Instead, you simply extend the
stand up time. I recommend 30 to 45 minutes. Yes, this means you’ll be
spending more time in the stand up, but you can communicate more about what
you’re doing, and how you are doing it. This helps to catch problems early on
and minimizes the need for developers to distract other developers while they’re
working.</p>

<h1><a name="discussion"></a>Discussion</h1>

<p>The idea behind WildAgile is not to formalize a new methodology, but to put
a name on a practice that is already moderately well-known but followed in an
almost embarrassed manner. It’s a way of following a set of reasonable
development guidelines that can eventually move on to a more appropriate Agile
development process. Think of it as “Agile light”, if you will. By putting a
name to it, you can say “we are WildAgile-compliant” instead of “eh, we just
get things done.”</p>

<p>In short, WildAgile eliminates the silo problem of cowboy coding, but allows
the extremely rapid development of products. It encourages creativity while
having Just Enough Process to keep development on target.</p>

<p>By separating developers into Apprentices and Veterans, I create the
psychological incentive to explore more of the code base. Ambitious developers
quickly want to shed the Apprentice label and fully participate in the rest of the
team’s work. However, by starting out by becoming an expert in one part of the
system, the Apprentice can quickly gain confidence in their ability to participate
and make a meaningful impact on the system.</p>

<p>Hiring for a WildAgile process is important. You want developers who are
comfortable in a fluid environment, but can also appreciate business concerns.
There is a tremendous amount of freedom in WildAgile and it’s very easy for
someone to get carried away and try to “perfect” (*cough*) everything at the
expense of adding value to the company. Thus, both the Team Lead and the PO are
required to keep things in check.</p>

<p>Also, WildAgile benefits from skilled, conscientious developers. It’s very
easy to spend too much time “perfecting” your code, but it’s also easy to spend
too much time pushing out new features and ignoring technical debt. This is a
hard balance to maintain. WildAgile does not address this directly because
every project is different and every company is different. However, as a
guideline WildAgile suggests that the PO advocate for features and the Team
Lead advocate for technical debt management, but each should be able to
understand and even agree with the other’s point of view. If you can’t balance
these two needs, you’re likely to have long-term problems.</p>

<p>In practice, I find this development model to be very successful for small
projects. The pace of development is very rapid and I don’t find that code
quality is significantly worse than for other methodologies. The most
significant obstacle that I find is appropriately managing the backlog.
Typically backlog items are merely added to a ticketing system, such as Jira,
RT, Redmine or Trac. This does not scale well unless the PO is competent at
managing the tickets and creating appropriate Priority tasks.</p>

<h2><a name="extending-wildagile"></a>Extending WildAgile</h2>

<p>Do you like retrospectives? Do them. Do you need milestones? Great! Do you
like pair programming? That’s fine.  WildAgile is designed to describe the
core of what successful development teams are already doing. Items outside of
this core are deliberately unspecified to allow you to customize WildAgile to
your heart’s content. A guiding principle of WildAgile should be “whatever
works for you.”</p>

<p>You are <em>encouraged,</em> nay, <em>required</em> to customize WildAgile
to meet the needs of your team.</p>

<h2><a name="wildagile-compliant"></a>WildAgile-Compliant</h2>

<p>Many teams are already WildAgile-compliant without even
knowing it. If you follow Scrum, you’re probably WildAgile-compliant. If you
follow XP, you’re probably WildAgile-compliant. If you do ad hoc development,
you may already be WildAgile-compliant. Don’t stress too much about it. I
don’t envision WildAgile-compliance courses. I don’t envision
WildAgile-certifications (though if you pay me enough money, I’m happy to
give a one-hour presentation and print up WildAgile-certifications for
you).</p>

<h1><a name="summary"></a>Summary</h1>

<p>Shut up and write some code.</p>

<p>Seriously, there is nothing radical about the above and it mirrors what
people are actually doing rather than forcing them to adopt a new methodology
all at once. You might view it as a gentle transition to more formal Agile
methodologies. Or, if it’s working fine for you, it might remain your Agile
methodology. Its very loose structure presents some risks, but a key component
of managing risk is being aware of it.</p>
